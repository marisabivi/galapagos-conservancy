    <h2 class="iabout">History</h2>
    <p>The Galapagos archipelago has been described as one of the most unique, scientifically important, and biologically outstanding areas on earth (UNESCO 2001). Many travelers describe their time in the islands as a life-changing experience. This section of our website will  introduce many aspects of life in Galapagos, from a bit about its history, to the people who live there, to the unique animals you’ll find across the islands.</p>
    <p>When the Charles Darwin Foundation was created in 1959, the human population in Galapagos was minimal. Tourism was essentially non-existent; fishing was at subsistence levels only; the agricultural community was small; and the Research Station was being built, board by board, by young scientists and local residents.</p>
    <p>Fifty years later, that landscape has changed dramatically and, to continue our work to preserve the archipelago, Galapagos Conservancy has changed, too.</p>
    <p>We remain committed to the biological research that is still needed in Galapagos and which has been at the core of the work of the Charles Darwin Foundation, our primary partner, for the last five decades. But today, Galapagos Conservancy supports a much broader research agenda, designed to ensure that decision makers have the insight, data, and context in which to make critical public policy decisions, as well as a wide range of sophisticated conservation and management programs on the ground.</p>

<div id="geology">
    <h2 class="iabout">Geology</h2>
    <p>Galapagos is located on the Nazca tectonic plate. This perpetually moving plate is heading eastward over the Galapagos hot spot and has formed the chain of islands. The islands were formed through the layering and lifting of repeated volcanic action. This geographic movement is correlated to the age of the islands, as the eastern islands (San Cristóbal and Española) are millions of years older than the western islands (Isabela and Fernandina).</p>
    <p>Most of the islands have a distinctive conical shape that is often associated with volcanic action. The mountainous islands have been formed through continuing eruption, building layer upon layer. Due to this volcanic formation, the islands are characterized by many steep slopes, with heights ranging from a few meters above sea level to more than 5000 feet above sea level.</p>
    <p>Each major island, with the exception of the largest island, Isabela, consists of a single large volcano. Isabela was formed when six volcanoes joined above sea level. Geologically, the Galapagos Islands are quite young, probably no more than five million years old. Some of the westernmost islands, which are the most volcanically active, may only be hundreds of thousands of years old and are still being formed today.</p>

    <h2 class="iabout">Species Arrival</h2>
    <h3 class="">Why the Galapagos Islands are Unique</h3>
    <p>Evolutionary Biologists are fascinated by island ecosystems and the clarity with which the species that inhabit them illustrate evolutionary processes. For this reason, as well as a world-changing historic visit from a man named Charles Darwin, the Galapagos Islands are quite arguably the most studied archipelago in the world.</p>
    <p>The Galapagos Islands also have a unique set of environmental conditions that set them apart from all other island groups in the world. Their sunny equatorial position on the globe combined with their location amid the cool Humboldt and Cromwell ocean currents allows these special islands to display a strange mix of both tropical and temperate environments, which is reflected in the complex and unusual plants and animals that inhabit them.</p>
    <h3 class="">Species Arrival</h3>
    <p>Five to ten million years ago, the tops of underwater Galapagos volcanoes appeared above water for the first time about 600 km from mainland Ecuador in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Those volcanic peaks were completely devoid of plant and animal life. All plants and animals that are now native to the islands must have arrived to the islands originally through some form of long-distance dispersal.</p>
    <p>When considering the diversity of species that do inhabit the Galapagos Islands, it is important to note how “unbalanced,” in comparison to continental species diversity, the variety of Galapagos species are. For instance, there are many native reptile species, but no amphibians; there is an abundance of land and sea bird species, but very few mammals. When considering plants, those with large flowers and big seeds are absent while grasses and ferns abound.</p>
    <p>There are two main ways for species to make their way to remote islands (aside from any methods involving humans). The first method is by air in the form of flying or being blown by wind, and the second method is by sea while swimming or floating, sometimes with the aid of rafts of tangled vegetation.</p>
    <h4 class="">By Sea</h4>
    <p>It is likely that the ancestors of present-day Galapagos animals that are good swimmers (sea lions, sea turtles, penguins) actually swam their way to the islands with the help of some swift ocean currents. On the other hand, it is believed that many of the reptiles and small mammals (rice rats) were carried to the islands from the South or Central American mainland on rafts of vegetation. The vast majority of such rafts would have sunk well before they ever reached Galapagos, but it would have only taken a handful of successful rafts to wash ashore to explain the present reptile diversity in Galapagos. This “raft” theory of arrival also explains why there are no native amphibians, few mammals, and many reptiles in the Galapagos Islands – reptiles are the best adapted to deal with the harsh salty and sunny conditions of weeks at sea.
Coastal plants, such as the mangroves and saltbushes of Galapagos, have seeds that are salt tolerant, and those seeds are, therefore, likely to have arrived by sea as well.</p>
    <h4 class="">By Air</h4>
    <p>Wind is thought to have played a major role in transporting spores of the lower-form plants, such as ferns, mosses, and lichens, to the Galapagos Islands. Vascular plants with heavier seeds are quite scarce in Galapagos because those seeds  would have had a more difficult time traveling by wind — with the exception of those plants with plumed seeds designed exactly for wind transport. This explains why members of the dandelion family (Compositae) are found throughout Galapagos.</p>
    <p>Many small insects, and even tiny snails, could have easily been blown by the breeze. The weaker-flying land birds and bats (2 species) likely arrived with the help of the wind. However, land bird species in Galapagos represent only a tiny fraction of those living on the mainland, and this is because it would have been a very difficult journey for the few who did make it.</p>
    <p>Sea birds, generally excellent fliers over long distances, simply flew their way to the islands. Birds likely brought with them hitch-hiking plant seeds or propagules that were attached to their feathers or feet, or even in their guts.</p>
    <h3 class="">Making Roots</h3>
    <p>The mere arrival of an organism to the Galapagos Islands is just one piece of the early survival puzzle. Organisms also had to be able to establish themselves once there, and, most importantly, to go on to reproduce. Scientists can only guess that many plant seeds accidentally made their way to Galapagos, were deposited in an unfavorable area, and perished soon after arrival. Not surprisingly, those plant species that were most successful at colonizing the Galapagos Islands were those of the “weedy” variety with wide tolerances for varying environmental conditions.</p>
    <p>One more problem facing new plant colonizers to the Galapagos Islands was pollination – many plants rely on insects or animals for pollination, and the chance of both a plant and its pollinator arriving to the islands together was unlikely. This can explain why there are so few showy flowering plants, which mostly require animal pollinators, but there are many wind-pollinated plants in the islands.
</p>
    <p>Quite simply, because animals are mobile, they have always had an advantage over plants in that they could move to more favorable areas on the islands, if such areas existed for them.</p>
    <h3 class="">Arrival to the Islands Today</h3>
    <p>In the last few centuries, humans have taken the place of birds as the primary source of new introductions of plants and animals to the Galapagos Islands. Unfortunately, many of the human introductions have been detrimental to previously established native or endemic wildlife – for example, harmful species such as fire ants, goats, and blackberry have all caused great harm to one or more of Galapagos’ iconic long-established pioneering species.</p>

<div id="discovery">
    <h2 class="iabout">Human Discovery</h2>
    <small class="reference">The following texts are from Galapagos: Both Sides of the Coin, by Pete Oxford and Graham Watkins (2009).</small>
    <p>The world first heard about Galapagos more than 470 years ago. The Dominican friar, Fray Tomás de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, was the official discoverer, arriving on March 10, 1535. Currents inadvertently drove Fray Tomás towards Galapagos, after he had set out from Panama on his way to Peru. His account is the first written record of Galapagos and describes the giant tortoises and cacti, the inhospitable terrain, and the difficulty of finding water—characteristic features of the islands. Since his visit, the arrival of humans and the decisions they have made have wrought many changes in these extraordinary islands.</p>
    <p>Over time, many different kinds of people have influenced Galapagos. The islands have attracted pirates, whalers, fur sealers, fishermen, scientists, colonists, and tourists—all with social and economic interests that have affected the flora and fauna of the islands. The resulting ecological changes include the decimation of populations of fur seals, giant tortoises, groupers, lobsters, sea cucumbers, and whales; the arrival of more than 1,400 new species of plants and animals; and large-scale changes to the near-shore marine and highland ecosystems. People have particularly modified the ecosystems on the colonized islands, including Floreana, Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Baltra, and Isabela and on the more accessible islands such as Española, Santiago, Pinta, and Pinzόn. Since their discovery, our decisions about what to do with these islands have had huge consequences.</p>

<div id="people">
    <h2 class="iabout">People Today</h2>
    <p>The Ecuadorian National Census of 2010 reports the Galapagos population at 25,124. 81% of the residents describe themselves as Mestizo, 7.5% as Native Indian (from the Ecuadorian mainland), 7.3% as Caucasian and 4.2% as African-Ecuadorian. Of those living permanently in Galapagos, 74% migrated from outside of the archipelago. Nearly 50% of these individuals report economic reasons as the driving force behind their relocation to Galapagos.</p>
    <p>The human population in Galapagos is limited to 3% (100 square miles/236.5 km2) of the land area of the islands. Approximately 85% of the inhabitants live in the coastal villages of Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz (9,208), Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, San Cristóbal (5,539), Puerto Villamil, Isabela (1,570), and Puerto Velasco Ibarra, Floreana (109), with the remainder living in the rural portions of Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal, Isabela and Floreana. </p>
    <p>The population has grown rapidly since the 1970s, driven by a rapidly growing tourism industry beginning in the mid 1970s and heavy government expenditures during Ecuador’s oil boom (1972-1983). Migration was fueled further by a weak economy in mainland Ecuador during the 1980s and 1990s and a boom in the sea cucumber fishery (1993-2000). From 1999 to 2005, the population in Galapagos grew by 60%. During much of the 80s and 90s, the population was increasing at more than 6% per year, compared  to about 2% on the Ecuadorian mainland. This rate would double the population in Galapagos every 11 years. </p>
    <p>The Galapagos Special Law of 1998 laid out immigration protocols which sought to limit the size of the resident population. However, loopholes and incomplete and inconsistent implementation of the Law resulted in continued growth.</p>
    <p>Uncontrolled immigration was among the 15 issues identified by the World Heritage Center andIUCN when it inscribed Galapagos on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 2007. Subsequently, the Ecuadorian government under President Correa implemented a policy known as “Zero people on irregular status in Galapagos,” which involved the implementation of a system of Transit Control Cards for visitors, a more transparent process for granting permanent and temporary residency status, and penalties (such as a one-year ban from entering Galapagos) for those whose status in Galapagos is found to be “irregular.” In 2009, 263 irregular residents were returned to the mainland, 694 were informed of their irregular status, and 257 were banned from returning to Galapagos for a period of one year. </p>
    <p>While progress is being made in the area of population control, it is generally believed that the pressure for more illegal and temporary immigrants to help serve the tourism sector will continue until tourism is better managed and more efforts are made to build the capacity of the local workforce.</p>
    <h3 id="govern" class="govern">Governance</h3>
    <p>Galapagos is one of 24 provinces in Ecuador. It is managed according to the Organic Law for the Special Regimen for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of Galapagos(LOREG), commonly referred to as the Special Law for Galapagos. The Special Law was approved and became part of Ecuador’s Constitution in 1998. It lays out legal framework over which many aspects of island life are to be regulated, including regional planning, inspection and quarantine measures, fisheries management, residency and migration, tourism, agriculture, and waste management. While the law places restrictions on rights Ecuadorians would have on the mainland (restrictions on migration, import of goods, where people live, the kind of pets they have, etc.) it offers certain rights not available to non-residents (various subsidies, access to tourism and fishing rights, etc.). The Special Law has been under revision since Ecuador adopted a new Constitution in 2008.</p>
    <p>Many institutions have decision-making powers in Galapagos that affect management and conservation efforts. According to Watkins and Martinez, in 2007 there were more than 50 central government organizations and 9 local organizations with decision-making responsibilities in Galapagos. More than 40 of these entities had a physical presence in Galapagos. The most significant of these are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong class="sg">The Consejo de Gobierno de Galapagos. (Governing Council of Galapagos)</strong> The Consejo is the organization responsible for overall management of the inhabited areas of Galapagos. It is headed by the Governor, who is appointed by the President of Ecuador. The Consejo is responsible for administration, planning, zoning, and the management of resources and organizing activities in Galapagos to assure conservation and “buen vivir” (in this contextbuen vivir refers to the indigenous concept of sumak kawsay–achieving a harmonious relationship between human beings and their surroundings—which is a key theme in Ecuador’s current constitution and public policy). The Consejo has its headquarters in the provincial capital of Puerto Baquerizo, San Cristóbal.</li>
        <li><strong class="sg">The Galapagos National Park Service (GNPS)</strong> is responsible for the management of both the marine and terrestrial protected areas of Galapagos. Its Director reports to the Minister of the Environment. In addition to its work in the protected areas, the Park Service is becoming increasingly involved in planning, education, and management activities in areas bordering the Park.</li>
        <li><strong class="sg">Municipal Governments</strong> in the archipelago’s three Cantons (Santa Cruz , San Cristóbal and Isabela). Each Municipality has an elected mayor and a city council of five members, who name a Vice Mayor. The parish of Floreana forms part of the Canton of San Cristóbal and has an elected Parish President.</li>
        <li>Two locally-elected representatives to the <strong class="sg">National Assembly.</strong></li>
        <li><strong class="sg">The Ecuadorian Agency for Quality Assurance (Agrocalidad).</strong>Agrocalidad is a service of the Ministry of Agriculture and is in charge of biosecurity issues in Galapagos and on the mainland. It manages the Quarantine and Inspection Service (SICGAL) for Galapagos.</li>
        <li><strong class="sg">The Ecuadorian Navy</strong> assists in the patrolling of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.</li>
        <li><strong class="sg">The Ministries of Tourism and Agriculture</strong> and a growing number of local NGOs also participate in management decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Watkins and Martinez estimated that in addition to the GNPS, there are more than 20 institutions that play a direct or indirect role in tourist management. These include the President’s Office, the National Assembly and Congress, Ministries (Natural Resources, Environment, Natural and Cultural Heritage, and Tourism), the Provincial Directorate of Tourism, local tourist boards, Municipal Councils, the Inter-Institutional Management Authority, Port Captains, Merchant Marine, Civil Aviation, the Navy and the Ministry of Defense.</p>
    <p>This complex, confusing and often conflicted decision-making framework was one of the 15 issues identified by The World Heritage Center and IUCN when it inscribed Galapagos on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger. This committee connected the existing governance structure with inadequate regional planning and unsustainable tourism development, noting the need for clearer authority, more transparency and accountability—especially as related to regional planning.</p>

    <h3 id="society" class="">Civil Society</h3>
    <p>The World Bank defines civil society as the wide array of non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations that have a presence in public life, expressing the interests and values of their members or others, based on ethical, cultural, political, scientific, religious or philanthropic considerations. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) include community groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, indigenous groups, charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associations, and foundations.</p>
    <p>The number of civil society organizations has grown rapidly in Galapagos since 1990. Watkins and Martinez (2007) identified an estimated 160 groups across the islands, 75% of them built around specific interests, such as fishing, tourism, labor, and conservation. They noted few broad-spectrum organizations that seek to establish a sense of community or collaboration. In recent years, however, several local organizations, such as FUNDAR Galapagos, Fundaciόn Scalesia, Galapagos ICE, and Fundación Nuevo Era are playing a larger, more visible role in local capacity building, citizen engagement, and conservation.</p>

<h3 id="economy" class="">Economy</h3>
    <p>Detailed information about the size and structure of the Galapagos economy has not been readily available. More up-to-date information will be made public when the Governing Council of Galapagos shares its analysis of Ecuador’s 2010 Economic Census in mid-2012.</p>
    <p>According to Epler (2007), the following sectors of the Galapagos economy generated a total of $185.8 million from June 2005 to May 2006:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tourism (53%).</strong>This major component of the Galapagos economy, tourism employs an estimated 40% of local residents. It is the primary driver of immigration, infrastructure development, and overall consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Public sector (38%).</strong>As explained in the section on Governance in Galapagos, the public sector in Galapagos grew initially during Ecuador’s oil boom (1973-1983) and has continued to expand with the growth of the resident population. Higher salaries offered to public sector employees have been a source of wage distortions in the local economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Conservation and science (6%).</strong>Non-profit, multi-lateral and bilateral conservation and science programs have represented a significant component of the insular economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Fishing (3%).</strong>While the fishing sector has received much attention from politicians, policy makers and the national and international media, this sector plays a small and shrinking role in the overall insular economy. The sector has been driven by international demand for sea cucumbers and spiny lobsters. According to Hern et. al (2006), gross income from these two fisheries added to the white fish fisheries generated US $7 million in 2006. Since that time, revenue has decreased significantly due to the dwindling populations of these species.</li>
        <li><strong>Agriculture</strong> represents a very small part of the economy, but more activity in this sector is critical to lessen the islands’ dependence on imported produce—one of the greatest sources of introduced species. Unfortunately, many farms have been abandoned, as owners have sought employment in the tourism sector. In recent years, several farmer groups and cooperatives have begun low-input greenhouse production of vegetables, which require fewer chemicals and efficient irrigation techniques.</li>

    <p>The Galapagos Islands are home to some of the highest levels of endemism (species found nowhere else on earth) anywhere on the planet. About 80% of the land birds you will see, 97% of the reptiles and land mammals, and more than 30% of the plants are endemic. More than 20% of the marine species in Galapagos are found nowhere else on earth. Favorites include the giant Galapagos tortoise, marine iguana, flightless cormorant, and the Galapagos penguin — the only penguin species to be found in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h3 id="plants" class="">Plants</h3>
    <p>Many visitors to Galapagos are surprised to be greeted by desert-like vegetation—most are expecting a continuation of the lush greenery they witnessed on mainland Ecuador. In fact, the majority of the archipelago’s land area is covered by the brown and grey vegetation often found in deserts. The Galapagos Islands are situated in the Pacific Dry Belt, and in average years only the highest altitudes of the larger islands receive enough rainfall to support tropical plant life.</p>
    <p>Geologically speaking, the islands are young, and much of the island’s plant life reflects this; many species seem to be in the midst of the evolutionary process, which makes classifying them a difficult task. To date, the islands are believed to be home to between 552 and 614 native species of vascular plants and approximately 825 introduced species, the majority introduced by humans. More than 100 of the introduced species have become established in the wild, with many of them extremely invasive and of major concern. Three introduced plant species have been eradicated. Mainland Ecuador, on the other hand, has about 20,000 species.  The discrepancy between species number on the Islands and the mainland highlights the fact that the Galapagos Islands are separated from the continent by a hostile saltwater barrier reducing the potential for arrival and, once a plant has arrived, establishment is difficult due to the harsh environment. It is worthy of note that more than 30% of native plant species found in Galapagos are endemic (not found anywhere else on earth).</p>
    <p>The flora of Galapagos can be grouped into three major vegetation zones: the coastal zone, the arid zone, and the humid highlands.</p>
    <ul class="plants">
        <li><strong>Coastal plants</strong>are found in the narrow zone near the shore and are distinctive because of their tolerance to salty conditions. Mangrove trees are one of the most common plants found in this zone, and they serve an important role as the breeding sites for many birds, such as pelicans and frigatebirds. They also provide much needed shade regions for iguanas and sea lions, as well as refuges for sea turtles.</li>
        <li><strong>The dry area</strong>is the most extensive zone in Galapagos and is comprised of plant species that are highly adapted to drought-like conditions, such as succulent cacti and leafless shrubs that flower and grow leaves only in the brief rainy season.</li>
        <li>Located above the dry zones are the very lush and green, <strong>humid zones.</strong> In portions of this zone, Scalesia trees form a very dense forest in the humid zone, with their branches adorned with mosses, liverworts, and epiphytes—non-parasitic plants that use larger trees only for support. The humid zone is only found on the larger, higher islands. The majority of islands in the archipelago do not rise in elevation above the arid zone.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="reptiles" class="">Reptiles</h3>
    <h3 class="">Giant Tortoises</h3>
    <p>The giant tortoises of Galapagos are among the most famous of the unique fauna of the Islands.  While giant tortoises once thrived on most of the continents of the world, the Galapagos tortoises now represent one of the remaining two groups of giant tortoises in the entire world — the other group living on Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean. The Galapagos Islands were named for their giant tortoises; the old Spanish word galapago meant saddle, a term early explorers used for the tortoises due to the shape of their shells.</p>
    <p>Tortoises have several ways of communicating with each other. The only known vocalization in Galapagos tortoises is the sound that males make when mating — a bellowing, periodic “groan” that sounds similar to a loudly mooing cow. Female tortoises make no vocalizations at all. The main method of tortoise communication is behavioral. Like many other species, they have ways of conveying dominance and defending themselves. Competing tortoises will stand tall, face each other with mouths agape, and stretch their necks up as high as possible. The highest head nearly always “wins,” while the loser retreats submissively into the brush.</p>
    <p>It is quite common to see the tiny birds of Galapagos, such as Darwin’s finches and Vermillion Flycatchers, perched on top of the shells of their oversized giant tortoise companions. Some finch species have developed a mutualistic relationship with giant tortoises, feeding on the ticks that hide in the folds of the tortoise’s reptilian skin. In fact, these birds will dance around in front of the tortoise to indicate that they are ready to eat, and the tortoise then responds by standing tall and stretching out its neck to “expose the buffet.”</p>
    <h3 class="">Iguanas and Lizads</h3>
    <p>Galapagos iguanas are thought to have had a common ancestor that floated out to the islands from the South American continent on rafts of vegetation. The divergence between land and marine iguanas has been estimated at 10.5 million years ago. Geneticists estimate that the pink iguana diverged from the other land iguanas approximately 5.7 million years ago — before most if not all of the current islands existed, while the divergence between the two yellowish iguanas is fairly recent. </p>
    <h4 class="">Land Iguanas</h4>
    <p>Land Iguanas
There are three species of land iguana found in the Galapagos Islands. The well-known yellowish land iguanas include Conolophus subcristatus, native to six islands, and Conolophus pallidus, found only on the island of Santa Fe. A third species of land iguana (Conolophus marthae), the pink or rosada iguana, was first seen in 1986 and remained unstudied until the 2000s.  It is found only on Wolf Volcano at the northern end of Isabela Island.  It has a pinkish head, and pinkish and black body and legs, often with black stripes. The new species is morphologically, behaviorally, and genetically distinguished from the other two.</p>
    <p>Land iguanas are large — more than 3 feet long — with males weighing up to 30 pounds. They live in the drier areas of the Islands, and in the mornings can be found sprawled beneath the hot equatorial sun. To escape the heat of the midday sun, they seek the shade of cacti, rocks, trees or other vegetation. At night they sleep in burrows dug in the ground, to conserve their body heat. They feed mainly on low-growing plants and shrubs, as well as fallen fruits and cactus pads. These succulent plants provide them with the moisture they require during long, dry periods. Land iguanas show a fascinating symbiotic interaction with Darwin’s finches, as do giant tortoises, raising themselves off the ground and allowing the little birds to remove ticks.</p>
    <p>Land iguanas reach maturity between 8 and 15 years of age. Males are territorial and will aggressively defend specific areas that typically include more than one female. Following the mating period, female iguanas find suitable nesting sites, dig their nesting burrow, and lay between 2 and 20 eggs. The female defends the burrow for a short time, to prevent other females from nesting in the same place. The young iguanas hatch 3-4 months later, and take about a week to dig their way out of the nest. If they survive the first difficult years of life, when food is often scarce and predators are a danger, land iguanas can live for more than 50 years.</p>
    <h4 class="">Marine Iguanas</h4>
    <p>Just about every rocky shoreline in the Galapagos Islands is home to the marine iguana(Amblyrhynchus cristatus), the only sea-going lizard in the world. The marine iguana is an extraordinary animal that lives on land but feeds in the sea, grazing on a variety of seaweed – on exposed rocks, in subtidal areas, or by diving deeper into the cold seawater. This habit, totally unique in iguanas and in fact all lizard species of the world, provides them with an abundant food source. However, they cannot withstand the cold temperatures of the sea for too long and must pull out on land to warm up.</p>
    <p>Marine iguanas also mate and nest on land. While they have few predators in the sea, on land, young iguanas fall prey to hawks, herons, and other birds. Predation by introduced cats has had a major impact on many populations. Found throughout the islands, concentrations of up to 4,500 individuals per mile are not uncommon in some areas. The total population has been estimated at between 200,000 and 300,000.</p>
    <p>The short, blunt nose is well-adapted to feeding on algae growing on rocks. The flattened tail is perfect for swimming, propelling the iguana through the water while its legs hang useless at its sides. Iguanas rid themselves of excess salt, consumed along with the algae, by a special gland connected to their nostrils. Marine iguanas are an excellent example of a species well-adapted and continuing to adapt to their environment. While marine iguanas feed mainly on algae, they have also been known to consume crustaceans and grasshoppers. On one or two islands, a small percentage of marine iguanas have been observed feeding on terrestrial vegetation, perhaps an adaptation to the near complete absence of nutritional sea algae during strong El Niño events.</p>
    <p>Marine iguanas show their color as they mature – the young are black, while adults range from red and black, to black, green, red and grey, depending on the island, with Española marine iguanas being the most colorful of all, and earning them the nickname “Christmas Iguanas.”  Marine iguanas become more colorful in the breeding season, at which time males defend territories on land where they mate with the females, who then lay their eggs in burrows.  Marine iguanas lay 2 to 3 large eggs, which hatch between 2 ½ and 4 months later.  Marine iguanas are known to live up to 60 years.</p>

    <h3 id="mammals" class="">Mammals</h3>
    <p>The variety of mammal species in the Galapagos Islands is rather limited, as is typical for most islands located far from mainland continents.  In fact, there are only 6 mammal species (that can be found on land) that are considered native to the islands, plus a number of aquatic mammals that swim in and out of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.</p>
    <h4 class="">Sea Lions</h4>
    <p>With a population size of about 50,000, the Galapagos Sea Lion (Zalophus californianus, subspecies: wollebacki) is one of the first animals that visitors to the Galapagos Islands encounter. They can often be found sprawled on the docks or benches where tourists board their cruise boats, and are found lounging on beaches or low rocky shorelines throughout the islands. Their playful and inquisitive behavior makes them a tourist favorite, and lucky divers or snorkelers may be treated to underwater gymnastic displays from these graceful creatures. Despite their curiosity, sea lions are wild animals and can be unpredictable in their behavior – especially the males – and people will occasionally be bitten for not respecting their space and privacy.</p>
    <p>Sea Lions are the largest animals found in Galapagos – full-grown males (bulls) can weigh up to 550 pounds. Besides their larger size, males differ from females in that they have a large “bump” on their foreheads and have extremely thick necks that provide protection.</p>
    <p>Once a year, females give birth to single pups, which they rear for one to three years. For this reason, it is common to see one mother with two suckling pups of different ages. Mothers will stay with their newborn pups for about 5 days, as they get to know each other’s sounds and smells, and then she will venture out to fish and replenish her energy. Baby sea lions will gather in shallow water nurseries that are watched over by one female, while the other mothers go out fishing. Bulls will even join in defending the nurseries from sharks, who may come looking for a defenseless pup meal. At about five months old, young sea lions will begin to learn to fish on their own.</p>
    <p>Females are sexually mature at around 5 years old, and can live to be about 20 years old – males mature a bit more quickly, but will not guard a harem until they are older, and they do not live as long as females.</p>
    <h4 class="">Fur Seals</h4>
    <p>Many people think Galapagos Fur Seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) are much less abundant in Galapagos than Sea Lions, but their population numbers are similar. Fur Seals typically prefer more rugged, rockier, and shadier shores than sea lions in areas that less likely to be frequented by people.  Fur seals are less tolerant of heat than sea lions, which is why they prefer cooler water and shaded areas. And despite their “seal” name, they are actually a type of sea lion.</p>
    <p>Galapagos Fur Seals and Sea Lions are morphologically similar, but there are some key physical differences that can help people tell them apart. Fur seals are generally smaller with broader and shorter heads. Fur Seals have bulging eyes and ears that protrude more than sea lions’, and larger front flippers that aid in climbing rockier coasts. The biggest difference is probably in their fur coat, which is much thicker and appears “furrier” on fur seals than on sea lions.</p>
    <p>Because of their remarkably insulating coats, fur seals were hunted by the tens of thousands in the 1800s, nearly to extinction. They have made an amazing comeback in their population numbers, and can be seen most easily by Galapagos tourists at James Bay on Santiago Island and in Darwin Bay on Genovesa Island.</p>
    <p>Fur seals’ social and breeding behaviors are quite similar to that of sea lions (see above), with a few differences. With regards to bulls defending territories, a fur seal bull will defend his harem from land, rather than from the water. Pups begin to hunt at about a year old, but will suckle from their mothers for two to three years. Though females can give birth every year, they will, at most, successfully raise one pup every two years. Should a second pup be born while a yearling is still suckling, the new pup has little chance of survival, despite being defended by its mother.</p>
    <h4 class="">Rice Rats</h4>
    <p>Unfortunately, only four of the original seven endemic Rice Rat species still exist in Galapagos; not surprisingly, these four species live on three islands that are not inhabited by humans – Santa Fé, Santiago, and Fernandina. The other three species of rice rats became extinct since humans colonized the islands and brought black rats with them. Competition with and/or a virus carried by the black rats is likely what brought about the demise of these three species.</p>
    <p>The ancestors of the native rats of Galapagos originally arrived to the Islands via rafts of vegetation that floated from the South American mainland out to Galapagos – these rats actually hold the world record for terrestrial mammal ocean crossings.</p>
    <h4 class="">Bats</h4>
    <p>There are two bat species present in Galapagos, but little is actually known about them.</p>
    <p>Lasiurus cinereus, the Hoary Bat from North America, is light brown with white fur tips, eats insects, and tends to prefer roosting in Mangrove trees or scrub bushes during the day. It is quite widespread and is found on Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal, Isabela, Santiago, and Floreana Islands.</p>
    <p>Lasiurus brachyotis is found on Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal in the highlands and coastal zones, and it is believe to migrate seasonally between the two zones. This bat forages near the ground while the Hoary Bat forages higher in the trees and air, which explains why they can coexist. L. brachyotis is believed to be closely related to the Red Bat of South America.</p>
    <h4>Dolphins and Whales</h4>
    <p>The aquatic mammals (cetaceans – whales, dolphins) form the last group of mammals found in the Galapagos Islands. Unlike most land mammals that are generally covered in hair or fur, these aquatic mammals have little, if any, hair. Instead, they have a fat layer of blubber which helps to maintain their body heat and to provide a reserve of energy when needed during long migrations or strenuous activity.</p>
    <p>The blubber of whales can be used to make oil, and this is what made them so valuable to humans in the 19th century when the Galapagos Islands were central to Pacific whaling activities. Fortunately today, whaling does not take place anymore in the Islands. Whales are occasionally seen passing through Galapagos, and dolphins are likely to be seen all around the islands.</p>
    <p>The Cetaceans fall into two major groups – those with teeth, and those with baleen (fringed whalebone that enables filter-feeding of plankton and small marine animals). Both groups of cetaceans, and several species from each group, can be found in the Galapagos Islands.Humpback whales are one of the easier baleen whales to identify because of their angled back, as well as their tendency to breach and splash dramatically back into the sea.</p>
    <p>Many species of toothed whales show up in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, including theSperm Whale, Killer Whale, False Killer Whales, the Pilot Whale, as well as several species of dolphins. There are two dolphin species that are quite abundant and easy to spot– theBottle-nosed Dolphin and the Common White-bellied Dolphin. The Bottle-nosed Dolphins are often found racing alongside boats, and sometimes they get close enough that people on board can hear their delightful squealing. Common Dolphins are more likely to be found in large schools of 100 or more individuals.</p>

    <h3 id="birds" class="">Birds</h3>
    <h4 class="gh4">Land Birds</h4>
    <p>The land birds as a group include two of the most impressive examples of evolutionary change in Galapagos – Darwin’s Finches and the Galapagos Mockingbirds. The group of 13 species of Darwin’s finches (with a 14th species found in the Cocos Islands some 650 km to the north), as a whole, are among the most abundant land birds. There are few textbooks of biology that fail to mention this amazing group. Each species has a distinctive beak size and shape, and their feeding behavior is specialized to their specific niche. Some eat seeds, some eat insects, some remove ticks from tortoises and land iguanas, some eat leaves, some eat flowers, some drink blood from seabirds, and two finch species use twigs or cactus spines to extract insect larvae from holes in dead tree branches. Together they fill the roles of seven different families of birds found on mainland South America. All of Darwin’s finches are sparrow-sized, ranging from the smallest Warbler Finch to the large Vegetarian Finch.  Woodpecker (Cactospiza pallidus) andMangrove (Camarhynchus heliobates) Finches use twigs and cactus spines to search for insect larvae. The Sharp-billed Ground Finch (Geospiza difficilis) parasitizes seabirds by hopping on the backs of Nazca and Red-footed Boobies where they peck at the skin until they are able to drink their blood. Drs. Peter and Rosemary Grant, along with their students and colleagues, have been studying the evolution of this incredible group of birds since the late 1970s. </p>
    <p>Mockingbirds are often the first animals to greet visitors when they land on an island.  The four mockingbirds, all in the endemic genus Mimus, constitute the second largest group of endemic species. While three of the species are island endemics (Floreana, San Cristóbal, and Hood/Española), the fourth species is found on three or more islands. Mockingbirds live primarily in the littoral, arid, and transition zones.  Though omnivorous (feeding on a wide variety of food types), they tend to be more predatory than their mainland relatives. They will eat young finches, lava lizards, insects, centipedes, carrion, and seabird eggs, among other things. They often form cooperative breeding groups consisting of a breeding pair plus their offspring from previous broods. The younger birds assist their parents in territory maintenance and defense and in rearing the new brood. Some groups contain more than one nesting female. Confrontations among mockingbirds from different breeding groups often occur at the borders of their territories and are fascinating to watch.</p>
    <p>The avian predators of the Galapagos Islands include the Galapagos Hawk, the Galapagos Short-eared Owl, and the Galapagos Barn Owl. The Galapagos Hawk feeds in the day while the Galapagos Barn Owl feeds at night. Short-eared Owls, on the other hand, feed at night on islands where Galapagos Hawks are present and in the day on islands that have no hawks. The female hawk has the unusual habit of mating with several males (polyandry), all of which help to incubate the eggs and rear the young. Hawks feed mainly on insects such as locusts and giant centipedes, as well as small lava lizards, snakes, and rodents. It is not uncommon for hawks to take young marine and land iguanas, and sea turtle and tortoise hatchlings.  Barn Owls are generally found in drier and more sparsely vegetated areas than the Short-eared Owls. Barn Owls nest in cavities of rock outcrops, holes in trees and abandoned (and sometimes not abandoned) buildings, whereas Short-eared Owls tend to nest under trees and shrubs. The partly diurnal Short-eared Owl, widespread in the Galapagos Islands, tackles large seabird chicks by attacking the neck. The barn owl feeds mostly on rodents and insects.</p>
    <p>Galapagos Doves are often seen near the coast and in the arid zones of many of the islands. Galapagos Doves feed primarily on seeds picked up from the ground. They will also take caterpillars when available. Cactus pulp also forms part of their diet and probably provides their main source of water. They nest on the ground and lay two white eggs. As ground-nesters, they are vulnerable to introduced rats. They have a beautiful blue eye ring and bright red legs and feet.</p>
    <p>Two flycatchers are found in Galapagos – the endemic Galapagos flycatcher or Broad-billed Flycatcher and the Vermilion Flycatcher (endemic at the subspecies level).  The Galapagos Flycatcher is the more widespread of the two species. The Vermilion Flycatcher population appears to be declining on the inhabited islands.  The male Vermilion Flycatcher is bright red, while the female is a more orange-rust color.  Both feed on insects caught in flight or from a perch or picked up from the ground.</p>
    <p>Among the lesser known endemic land birds of Galapagos are the tiny, secretive Galapagos Rail, which inhabits higher ground above 1500 feet where it feeds on invertebrates and seeds and rarely flies, and the Galapagos Martin, which feeds on insects caught in the air.</p>
    <h3 class="">Sea and Shore Birds</h4>
    <h4 class="">Sea Birds</h4>
    <p>The Galapagos Islands are a mecca for tropical seabirds, including Blue-footed, Red-footed, and Nazca Boobies, Flightless Cormorants, Great and Magnificent Frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Waved Albatross, Swallow-tailed Gulls, Lava Gulls, Galapagos Penguins, and many more. Seabirds provide some of the greatest opportunities to observe wildlife in the islands – especially in the large breeding colonies. </p>
    <p>Galapagos Penguins, one of the smaller penguins of the world, are the only penguins that live at or just above the equator. The penguin population of about 2000 individuals is concentrated in the colder, nutrient-rich waters in the western islands – Fernandina and Isabela (about 95% of the population). However, small isolated populations are found at some small satellite islands off the coast of Santiago and along small sections of the northern coast of Floreana. Galapagos penguins breed throughout the year and nest at sea level in caves. They forage relatively close to shore and at relatively shallow depths.  Long-term monitoring has shown that this species undergoes severe fluctuations, primarily related to El Niño events and their effects on the availability of fish. The extreme El Niños of 1982-83 (77% reduction in the population) and 1997-98 (66% reduction) caused a long-term reduction in the population over the last 30 years. Although the current population is relatively stable, the species is listed as Endangered by the IUCN due to small population size, restricted range, and its vulnerability to El Niños. Climate change may lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of El Niño events further endangering this population.</p>
    <p>Lava Gulls are one of the least known of the seabirds. Although widespread throughout the archipelago, Lava Gulls do not form large breeding colonies and are usually observed in single pairs. The population is estimated at 900-1200 individuals. The reason for the tiny population and the solitary nesting behavior is not fully understood but is thought to be related to its feeding behavior. Lava Gulls nest solitarily in scrapes on sandy beaches or low outcrops close to water. The female lays two eggs. A gull’s territory is large and adults are extremely wary when nesting.  They are scavengers but will also take seabird eggs, juvenile marine iguanas, small fish, and crustaceans. This poorly known species is considered Vulnerable because of its small population size. Although its numbers appear stable, there are numerous potential threats.</p>
    <p>The three booby populations are the most common and most frequently seen of the seabirds. Similar in appearance to gannets, they are large birds (70-90 cm in length) with long narrow wings. Their long pointed beaks gave rise to their Spanish name piquero. Boobies have a strong direct flight movements, with several powerful rapid wing beats followed by a glide. All of the booby species feed by spectacular plunge diving into the sea and then catching fish on their way back to the water surface. All three species tend to live in groups, but in the Galapagos Islands, they range from widely distributed small colonies of Blue-footed Boobies to the larger, less frequent colonies of the Nazca Boobies, to the few huge colonies of Red-footed Boobies. The number of eggs laid by each species is related to where they feed, with Blue-footed Boobies feeding near shore, the Nazca Boobies feeding further offshore, and the Red-foots feeding out in the open ocean. The farther they must go to their feeding grounds the fewer eggs they lay.  Blue-footed Boobies lay 1-3 eggs. When times are good, they may successfully fledge all three chicks. Nazca Boobies lay two eggs with only a single chick surviving. The death of the second chick is usually due to siblicide (death caused by a sibling or close relative) by the older chick (born a few days earlier). Siblicide is apparently obligatory in the Nazca Booby species.  Although the smallest and least often seen by humans in Galapagos, Red-footed Boobies are the most abundant of the three species. However, since they feed far out to sea, they nest in the outermost islands with access to open ocean and lay a single egg.  While the Blue-footed and Nazca Boobies nest on the ground, Red-foots nest in trees and shrubs. The Red-foots also have two color phases, the large majority (95%) with a brown body and the rest with a white-and-black body.</p>
    <h4 class="">Shore Birds</h4>
    <p>The most commonly seen shore and water birds include the Galapagos flamingo, the many heron species including Great Blue Herons, Yellow-crowned Night Herons, Lava Herons, Black-crowned Herons and Striated Herons, Oystercatchers, White-cheeked pintails, Gallinules, and Common Egrets.</p>
    <p>The Galapagos Flamingo population is approximately 320-350 individuals. This is the world’s smallest flamingo population and is listed as Endangered on the Red List for birds in Ecuador. The small population size has resulted in changes in breeding behavior compared to other flamingo populations worldwide, which all need very large groups of birds for breeding to occur.  Galapagos Flamingos can breed with just a few pairs present. They live in the saltwater lagoons close to the sea and filter feed primarily on brine shrimp. Young flamingos hatch with grey plumage. The pink color of the adults is due to aqueous bacteria and beta carotene obtained from their food supply. The population appears stable but they are threatened by introduced animals such as rats, cats, and pigs. Intense El Niños can affect their food supply and severely impact their habitat making nesting impossible. </p>
    <p>The largest of the herons, the Great Blue, eats much larger prey than the other heron species. The Lava Heron catches fish by stealth, watching from a rock just out of the water until a fish passes and then grabbing it. The Lava Heron also eats small crabs, but the Yellow-crowned Night Heron, which hunts at night, could be considered the crab-eating specialist.</p>
    <h3 id="marine" class="">Marine Life</h3>
    <p>The Galapagos archipelago is located at a point where major ocean currents come together, mingling nutrient rich cool waters from the south, warm currents from the north, and a deep cold current from the west. This convergence of ocean currents has combined flora and fauna from contrasting environments, and given rise to unique marine species.</p>
    <p>Nearly 20% of marine life in Galapagos is endemic, found nowhere else on earth. This level of endemism is rare for marine species, which tend to migrate and intermingle to a much larger degree than terrestrial (land-based) species.</p>
    <p>The Galapagos Islands are home to the world’ s only marine iguana and the most northern-living penguin. Coral beds share the same waters as fur seals. Galapagos is one of the only places where pelagic species (species that live neither close to the bottom of the ocean nor near the shore) such as tunas, manta rays, and hammerhead sharks can be seen close to shore. No other site in the world showcases such a diversity of marine life forms. </p>
    <p>Additionally, geological and biological processes in Galapagos have helped create a high variety of habitats relative to other marine areas in the eastern Pacific. Coastal areas include vertical cliffs, sandy beaches, rocky shores, mangroves, coral reefs, lagoons, and salt flats (hypersaline panne habitats). Submarine mountains, plateaus, ridges, and valleys provide habitat to an array of marine communities, while the open ocean waters attract stocks of pelagic fish.</p>

      <h3 class="">Baltra</h3>
      <ul class="islandinfo">
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> 21km<sup>2</sup> or 8 mi<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Maximum Altitude:</strong> 100m or 328ft</li>

        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Also known as South Seymour, Baltra is a small, flat island located near the center of the archipelago that was formed by a series of uplifts of submarine lava, resulting in flat plateaus. The island was of little interest to humans until the 1930s, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited aboard the USS Houston, as the US government sought to establish an air base in the Pacific to protect the western approach to the Panama Canal. While consideration was given to San Cristóbal because of its water supply and human population, Baltra was chosen because of its location at the center of the archipelago and its flat topography. Construction of the airbase began in February 1942 and within two months a mile-long airstrip was completed. With time, associated infrastructure grew to over 200 buildings, including barracks for 1,000 soldiers, hangars, office buildings, an outdoor beer garden, a cinema, and even a bowling alley (constructed after Eleanor Roosevelt visited the island and described conditions for the soldiers as “deplorable”). From the air it is still possible to see the foundation lines of many of these buildings. Soldiers stationed on Galapagos referred to Baltra as “The Rock” and were considered among the toughest members of the US Sixth Air Force.</p>
      <p>At the end of the war, the United States turned the base over to the Ecuadorian government, which offered each head of household in Galapagos one of the buildings. Many carefully deconstructed their building to provide building material for their own homes on both Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal. Ecuador used the base to establish their own airstrip in Galapagos, with the first commercial flights arriving in 1963. Today the island continues to serve as an official Ecuadorian military base, with bases for both the Navy and the Air Force. Baltra has the primary fueling station for boats out of Santa Cruz.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Baltra Island, home to one of two airports connecting Galapagos with mainland Ecuador, is the point of arrival for most travelers to Galapagos. After clearing the immigration desk at the airport, travelers are transported by bus to the cruise ships anchored at Aeolian Bay or to the dock at the Itabaca Canal, where ferry service connects Baltra with the island of Santa Cruz. In 2007, the Baltra Airport began remodeling to include additional restaurants, shops and an improved visitor area. The remodeling was expected to be finished by late 2008. Baltra is arid and its vegetation is dominated by salt bush, prickly pear cactus and Palo Santo trees. A large number of birds can be observed, including boobies and frigatebirds. There are no visitor sites on Baltra. However, there are visitor sites on nearby islands, including North Seymour, Mosquera, and Daphne Major. In addition, there are five marine sites around North Seymour and Daphne Major and Minor.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Baltra Airport has the most flights into and out of Galapagos. Over 2,000 commercial flights arrive in Galapagos each year, with approximately two-thirds arriving in Baltra. A few hundred private airplanes arrive each year as do a few hundred military flights (mostly in San Cristóbal). All of these present a risk for introducing exotic species to the islands. </p>
      <p>A small, flat, sandy islet almost devoid of vegetation, Mosquera sits in the channel between Baltra and North Seymour. It has one of the largest populations of sea lions and its sandy expanses offer visitors the perfect chance to observe their behavior. It is a beautiful site to observe Lava Gulls, coastal birds, and Sally Lightfoot Crabs.
</p>
      <p>Land iguanas were extinct on Baltra by 1954. While US soldiers are often pointed to as the cause of the iguana’s demise, by the early 1930s observations of the iguanas on Baltra indicated that they were already in poor condition. Due to their condition and the fact that the island just north of Baltra, very similar in both geology and vegetation, had no iguanas, the team of scientists on the Hancock Expedition (G. Alan Hancock was a wealthy Californian industrialist) transferred approximately 70 iguanas to neighboring North Seymour in 1931-32.</p>
      <p>The ultimate demise of the last iguanas on Baltra is attributed to a combination of factors including habitat destruction by introduced goats, predation by introduced cats and dogs, and additional habitat destruction caused by the construction and use of the US air base. In 1980, several iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the iguana center on Santa Cruz for breeding and in 1991, the first 35 young land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra. By 1997, scientists recorded 97 iguanas living on Baltra, 13 of which were born on the island. Within another decade, a total of 420 iguanas were living and reproducing on Baltra and the population is now considered healthy.</p>

        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Bartolomé Island was named after Sir Bartholomew James Sulivan, a friend of Charles Darwin who served as principal surveyor and second-lieutenant aboard the HMS Beagle. Bartolomé is a barren islet in Sullivan Bay to the east of Santiago Island. Bartolomé is home to a distinctive and recognizable site of the archipelago: Pinnacle Rock. Pinnacle Rock, a volcanic cone, was formed when magma was expelled from an underwater volcano; the sea cooled the hot lava, which then exploded, only to come together and form this huge rock made up of many thin layers of basalt. Visitors to Bartolomé may recognize the island and Pinnacle Rock from the 2003 blockbuster movie “Master and Commander.”</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Bartolomé is the most visited and most photographed island in Galapagos. Visitors have access to two sites: one that involves a climb to an incredible viewpoint and the other at the beach where snorkeling and swimming is enjoyed. Birdwatchers should be on the lookout for Galapagos Penguins, herons, and Galapagos Hawks.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>The Galapagos Penguins, the second smallest penguin species in the world, have established a small breeding colony in a cave behind Pinnacle Rock. In 1982, these creatures suffered a massive decline during El Niño when the overall population in Galapagos declined from nearly 15,000 to fewer than 500 birds and they have been slow to recover. The most recent cause of concern came in July 2008 when a Plasmodium parasite species was found in Galapagos Penguins. Researchers are worried that this parasite could potentially lead to avian malaria. The penguin population in Bartolomé will be monitored to ensure their health and survival.</p>
      <p>Visitors land across the small bay, opposite Pinnacle Rock. They proceed to climb a 600-m trail to the 114-m summit (the climb includes a wooden staircase constructed by the Park Service to protect the island from erosion). The summit provides spectacular views of Pinnacle Rock, the immense black lava flows at Sullivan Bay and the rest of Santiago Island, and Daphne Major and Minor. Along the way, various volcanic formations including spatter and tuff cones and lava flows are seen. The climb also gives the visitor a unique insight into species adaptation. The Tequila plant, which appears to be dead brush, is actually made of leaves covered with small gray hairs, which help prevent moisture evaporation and reflect sunlight.</p>
      <p>Visitors land on the north beach adjacent to Pinnacle Rock. Swimming is allowed on the northern beach, one of the smaller Green Sea Turtle nesting beaches in the archipelago (nesting season is from January to March). Visitors have the opportunity to swim with colorful fish, sea lions and Galapagos Penguins, as well as swim and snorkel around Pinnacle Rock. Galapagos Penguins are usually seen playing. A short trail through the vegetation leads the visitor to the southern beach (no swimming allowed), where stingrays, Spotted Eagle Rays and Black-tipped Sharks can be seen. White-tipped Sharks are present close to shore at both beaches.</p>
      <p>The dive site encircles the large portion of the island. Species most often seen include penguins, sea turtles, sharks, and rays. Red-lipped Batfish are found in the deeper sandy areas. Both swimming and diving are not allowed in front of the southern beach.</p>

      <p>Although visits to Daphne Major are strictly limited, its location between Santa Cruz, Baltra and Santiago Islands — all with large numbers of introduced species — is some cause for concern, especially given its importance as a natural laboratory for evolutionary research. Any species carried by the wind could potentially arrive on either of the Daphnes, although establishment of these species might be limited by the arid conditions.</p>
      <p>Daphne Major is a rather large tuff cone somewhat eroded by the sea. It is a very fragile visitor site and requires a special permit. Nazca boobies, red-billed tropicbirds, and blue-footed boobies can be found nesting here. Daphne Major is the primary site of Peter and Rosemary Grant’s iconic 40-year study of evolution in Darwin’s finches that demonstrates evolution occurring over short periods of time. Nearly all of the finches on the island are banded.</p>
      <p>Two dive sites encircle the smaller islands of Daphne Major and Daphne Minor. At Daphne Major, divers can observe sea lions, sea turtles, Eagle Rays, various species of sharks, and other pelagic species. Daphne Minor offers something a bit more unique. There divers can observe the large quantity of benthic organisms that live on the underwater walls of the island, all of which create a multi-colored aspect to the undersea world. Sea horses can be seen around the black corals and Galapagos Sharks and sometimes rays and sea turtles are present.</p>

      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Darwin Island (also known as Culpepper Island, after the famous naturalist and English Lord Culpepper) was named after Charles Darwin. Its exceptional underwater life is an important reason that Galapagos is considered one of the Seven Underwater Wonders of the World. It is the northern-most island, located some 160 km NW of Isabela on the Wolf-Darwin volcanic ridge. Darwin and Wolf Islands are the most remote in the archipelago, with Darwin about 21 km to the north of Wolf. Large schools of Hammerhead Sharks frequent the waters around Darwin Island. The first terrestrial visit to Darwin Island took place in 1964 with the aid of a helicopter. Darwin, like Wolf Island, is the tip of a massive, mostly subsurface volcano that rises over 1,000 m above the sea floor. Now extinct, it is estimated to be from 400,000 to 1.6 million years old.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Darwin Island is inhabited only by sea birds and is rarely visited by tourists other than master divers. There is no terrestrial visitor site on the island. The island is well-known among divers for its diverse and abundant marine wildlife. It is not unusual to see large schools of Hammerhead Sharks. A main attraction of this tiny island is the impressive stone arch formation, known as Darwin Arch. This arch is home to many endemic birds. Darwin Island is the only island in the archipelago where the Sooty Tern (Sterna fuscata) breeds.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Given the great distance from the central islands, both Darwin and Wolf Islands are vulnerable to unregulated fishing and dive tourism. To improve management in the area, in the fall of 2008, the Galapagos National Park established a permanent floating base at Wolf Island for patrolling these northern waters.</p>
      <p>A small islet off the southeast coast of Darwin Island, Darwin Arch is one of the best dive sites in the archipelago. Whale sharks and large schools of Hammerhead Sharks are the principal draw to this site. Also present are sea turtles, manta rays, dolphins, large schools of pelagic fish species, as well as other species of sharks.

       <div id="española" style="display:none;">
      <h3 class="">Española</h3>
      <ul class="islandinfo">
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> 60km<sup>2</sup> or 137mi<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Maximum Altitude:</strong> 206m or 675ft</li>
      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Española is the southernmost of the Galapagos Islands and is also one of the oldest. Geologists estimate it is about four million years old. Española is a classic shield volcano, created from a single caldera in the center of the island. Over thousands of years, the island slowly moved away from the Galapagos hot spot where it was formed and the volcano became extinct. Erosion began to occur, eventually resulting in one of the flattest islands in the archipelago with one of the lowest elevations. </p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>The quantity and variety of wildlife found on Española make its two visitors sites among the most popular and attractive of the archipelago. Because Española is one of the most isolated islands in Galapagos, it has a large number of endemic species — the Española mockingbird, the Española lava lizard, and the waved albatross, to name a few.</p>       
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>The Española giant tortoise species was rescued from the brink of extinction and is now one of Galapagos’ greatest conservation success stories. Starting with only 14 individuals found on the island in the 1960s, scientists and resource managers at the Charles Darwin Foundation and Galapagos National Park have since released nearly 2,000 young tortoises on Española where they are now thriving. </p>
      <p>Española is probably most well-known for being the sole breeding ground for the entire population of the world’s Waved Albatrosses. Given their limited breeding range, the species was originally listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. However, in 2007 it was changed to Critically Endangered due to its decreasing population resulting from threats including fishing in waters near the mainland, oil pollution from fishing boats, and global warming and its effects on the frequency and strength of El Niño events. The Waved Albatross population is currently being monitored by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park Service and activities to protect them and their habitat are underway.</p>
      <p>One of the most popular visitor sites in Galapagos, Punta Suarez has an amazing variety and quantity of wildlife. Lazy sea lions may greet visitors at the rocky landing site, forcing visitors to step over or around them to get to the trail. Groups of young sea lions are often found nearby playing in the shallow water, waiting for their mothers to return with food. Brightly-colored red and green marine iguanas can be found lining the coastal areas near the landing site. They are the only marine iguanas that remain brightly colored throughout the year.</p>
      <p>The trail passes by a small beach occupied by more sea lions and large and colorful Española Lava Lizards. It then cuts through some saltbush, where Galapagos Hawks, Española Mockingbirds, three species of Darwin’s finches, and Galapagos Doves all go about their business. Visitors then come upon the impressive nesting colonies of Blue-footed and Nazca boobies, who make their nests right along the visitor trail near the western cliffs of the island. Swallow-tailed Gulls and Red-billed Tropicbirds dash in and out of the cracks in the cliffs. Continuing inland, the trail leads to a cliff on the southern side of the island overlooking the ocean. Waves crash into a lava fissure, creating a blowhole that sprays water nearly 30 m into the air at high tide.</p>
      <p>The highlight of this visitor site — and perhaps one of the highlights of the Galapagos Islands — is strolling along the edge of the Waved Albatross breeding colony. With a population of 25,000 to 30,000, nearly the entire world population of the adult birds can be found on Española between April and December. They mate for life and perform an elaborate mating dance, a spectacle that can last five days and may include stumbling, honking, and beak-fencing. Waved Albatross pairs produce a single egg each year and share responsibility for its incubation. Their grace in the air is sharply contrasted by their comic clumsiness on land. Lucky visitors will observe Waved Albatrosses wobble awkwardly to the cliff’s edge before launching themselves into the wind to take flight—many of them for the very first time in December. The entire colony leaves Española by January to fish for three months before returning. The young albatrosses will remain at sea for about five years before returning to Española to seek their mate.</p>
      <p>The beach at Gardner Bay offers one of the best beaches to experience “relaxing beach time” in Galapagos. The expansive white sand beach (one of the longest in Galapagos at 2 km) attracts many napping sea lions, as well as tourists. There is no inland trail and visitors are required to remain on the beach. Three species of Darwin’s finches and Española Mockingbirds may be seen at this site. Española Mockingbirds are fearless and frequently land on visitors’ heads and shoulders in search of food. This mockingbird is slightly larger than other mockingbird species found in Galapagos. It has a long, curved beak and is the only carnivorous mockingbird species, feeding on a variety of insects, turtle hatchlings, sea lion placentas, and even baby boobies. Visitors can swim or snorkel along the rocks in the shallow water near the beach. Green Sea Turtles may be found gliding through the water or hauling themselves onto the beach for a rest or for nesting (between January and March).</p>

     <div id="fernandina" style="display:none;">
      <h3 class="">Fernandina</h3>
      <ul class="islandinfo">
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> 642km<sup>2</sup> or 248mi<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Maximum Altitude:</strong> 1476m or 4842ft</li>
      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Fernandina Island first appeared on the navigational charts and crude map produced by the British buccaneer Ambrose Cowley in 1684. He named it Narborough Island in honor of Sir John Narborough, an English naval commander of the 17th century. Its Spanish name, Fernandina, was given to honor King Fernando of Spain, who sponsored the voyage of Christopher Columbus.</p>
      <p>The island is most famous for its continuing series of volcanic eruptions. Many of the early visitors to the archipelago commented on dramatic changes in the landscape, smoking craters, and actual eruptions. The most famous of these is the description of a violent eruption in 1825 by Benjamin Morrell, the captain of the New York-based schooner Tartar. Another important historical event was the discovery and collection in 1906 by Rollo Beck of the California Academy of Sciences Expedition of the only giant tortoise ever found on Fernandina.</p>
      <h4 class="">Geology</h4>
      <p>Fernandina is the westernmost island in the Galapagos Islands, the third largest and youngest of the islands, less than one million years old. It is the most volcanically active and sits at the center of the hot spot that created the Galapagos Islands.</p>  
      <p>La Cumbre Volcano is a shield volcano similar to those found in the Hawaiian Islands. Its summit caldera is approximately 6.5 km wide. During an explosive eruption in 1968, the caldera collapsed, falling approximately 350 m. The northern floor of the caldera has intermittently held a small lake, whose size, boundaries and position have periodically altered during eruptions. Recent eruptions have occurred both in the caldera and on the outer slopes of the volcano, with some of them reaching the sea. Since the establishment of the Galapagos National Park, there have been 13 recorded eruptions on Fernandina, with some of them lasting for several days. The most recent eruptions were in May of 2005 and April 2009.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>Fernandina remains the most active and most pristine of the Galapagos volcanoes. Except for a single visitor site on the northeast edge of the island, the island is maintained in its pristine state. Fernandina has a large land iguana population, which nests both on the rim of the caldera and in its depths.  Due to the cold, upwelling waters of the subsurface Cromwell Current that hits the archipelago from the west where it is pushed to the surface, the waters surrounding Fernandina and western Isabela are the richest waters in the archipelago. These cold waters also provide prime habitat for both Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Fernandina is the most pristine of the Galapagos Islands. Two species of the endemic rice rats are found there. The majority of rice rat species on the other islands went extinct following the introduction of Black and/or Norway Rats. Fernandina and Genovesa are the only larger islands that have never had introduced mammals. The greatest threat to the flora and fauna is the potential for future introductions of aggressive exotic species. A single tourist site on the island helps to limit potential arrivals. However, the 1990s saw several illegal camps of local fishermen on Fernandina during the peak of the sea cucumber fisheries (both legal and illegal). Periodic monitoring to detect new introductions, especially of rats, must be carried out regularly to ensure the protection of the pristine environment.</p>
      <p>This visitor site offers two major components – the short walk around the small peninsula and a longer walk inland to the edge of a large aa lava flow.</p>
      <p>This point has been raised and lowered a number of times as a result of geologic activity throughout its history, with the last known activity in 1975, when it was raised approximately 40 cm, leaving corals and red mangroves exposed.</p>
      <p>The highlights along the coast include Marine Iguanas and Flightless Cormorants. The Marine Iguanas nest here in the early part of the year with young emerging around June. At that time, snakes are commonly seen in the nesting zone. Other attractions include penguins, sea lions, Sally Lightfoot Crabs, and occasionally Galapagos Hawks and land iguanas.Punta Espinosa is also one of the best places to see the Lava Cactus. One of the first species to grow on young lava, it can survive with very little water. The walk inland is predominantly through a pahoehoe lava field but it ends at a great wall of aa lava.</p>
      <p>Two dive sites are also located on Fernandina. The first is adjacent to the land site at Punta Espinosa and the second further to the south at Punta Mangle. Both are good sites for observing Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins, sea horses, marine iguanas, sea turtles, and various species of sharks and rays.</p>

       <div id="floreana" style="display:none;">
      <h3 class="">Floreana</h3>
      <ul class="islandinfo">
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> 173km<sup>2</sup> or 107mi<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Maximum Altitude:</strong> 640m or 2100ft</li>
      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>~100 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Floreana Island has, arguably, the most interesting human history of all of the Galapagos Islands. It is the site of the first “post office”, established in 1793 by whalers, and it was the home to the first Galapagos resident — a bold Irishman named Patrick Watkins who lived there from 1807-1809.</p>
      <p>Floreana was the first island to be colonized by Ecuadorians in 1832. It was a penal colony that didn’t last long because of the lack of fresh water. A fish canning plant was established there by Norwegian immigrants in 1924; it lasted only a couple of years. A few years later, Friedrich Ritter, a German doctor, arrived with his female companion Dore Strauch, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. A doctor of holistic medicine, Ritter removed all of his teeth and took with him stainless-steel dentures to avoid any dental complications. Together, they set up a very successful garden and lived off the land.</p>
      <p>A pregnant Margret Wittmer arrived in 1932, with her husband Heinz and her step-son Harry. They built a house and also established an agricultural lifestyle before giving birth to their son Rolf, the first person to be born in Galapagos.Floreana is most well-known for being the site of several mysterious disappearances in the 1930s—the one receiving the most attention being that of a supposed Austrian baroness, who had arrived shortly after the Wittmers with her three servants.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>The majority of Floreana residents make their living by farming. The main water source for Floreana is a natural pond that fills up with rain water during the rainy season; during droughts water problems can become quite serious for the population. Transportation to and from Floreana is very limited, with a boat from Santa Cruz Island arriving, on average, every two weeks.
</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Of all the Galapagos Islands, Floreana is the one most altered by the presence of humans and invasive feral goats. The goats and some other invasive herbivores were completely removed by the Galapagos National Park in 2007, but a devastated landscape no longer fit to sustain Floreana’s native wildlife was left in their wake.</p>
      <p>Conservation work is now focused on restoring healthy populations of Galapagos racers (snakes), hawks, barn owls, rails, three species of finch, and most notably, the Floreana Mockingbird. Now extinct on the main island of Floreana, the Floreana mockingbird can only be found in two small populations located on two small satellite islands off the coast of Floreana.</p>
      <p>Approximately two-thirds of Floreana’s 100 residents live in the port town; the remaining one third live in the volcanic highlands. The Pension Wittmer, run by the Wittmer family, descendants of one of the first families to live in Galapagos, is the only hotel and it boasts the only telephone on the entire island. This small hamlet also has a newly-built church and one school with two teachers. There are currently no restaurants or bars.
</p>
      <p>Visitors who disembark in Puerto Velasco Ibarra can travel to the highlands by vehicle to visit two additional sites. The first, Cerro Alieri, is approximately a 15-minute ride from port. This site is of most interest to those who enjoy the plants of Galapagos. Over 48 different species have been identified here, 56% of which are native and 33% endemic. In addition, this is the site of a major conservation program for a critically endangered plant, Linum cratericola. It was believed extinct until it was reencountered by scientists and park wardens in 1997.</p>
      <p>The second site, Asilo de la Paz, is a 45-minute ride from town. It is primarily an historical site where visitors can view the cave of the pirates and the fresh water spring that is the main source of water for the population. Both are located at the base of Asilo de la Paz, a 450-m high cone. A nearby corral contains the various giant tortoises that were originally owned by residents of Floreana.</p>
      <p>When Charles Darwin visited the islands in 1835, he discovered and participated in the description of the four endemic mockingbird species. Today, three of the four species are on the Red List for birds, with the Floreana Mockingbird (N. trifasciatus) considered Critically Endangered. Champion and Gardner-by-Floreana, the last refuges for the Floreana Mockingbird, are two small, pristine islets. The current population on Champion (the smaller of the two islets) fluctuates between 20-40 individuals, while Gardner-by-Floreana maintains a population of 60-80 birds. Annual fluctuations in abundance are dependent upon precipitation. With an overall population of fewer than 100 individuals, the probability of an ecological disaster is extremely high. If there is not an immediate and concerted effort to effectively manage and protect the Floreana mockingbird, it may become the first bird species in the Galapagos Islands to reach extinction.</p>
      <p>To ensure that the mockingbird populations survive in these refuges, the Charles Darwin Foundation completes an annual census to determine the size and health of the population and to highlight any trends, both positive and negative. These annual visits also ensure rapid discovery of new threats, such as the introduction of invasive species or disease. Results from these annual visits can then be quickly incorporated into the management program of the Galapagos National Park. In addition, there are plans to repopulate Floreana with the Floreana Mockingbird as part of the Floreana Restoration Project. </p>

      <li><strong>Maximum Altitude:</strong> 64m or 210ft</li>
      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Genovesa Island is a horse-shoe shaped island located in the northeastern region of the Galapagos Archipelago. Its distinct shape was formed from the eruption of a shield volcano (a volcano with broad, gentle slopes built up over time by repeated lava flows and resembling a “shield”) and the eventual collapse of one side of the caldera. The resulting submerged crater formed Darwin Bay, which is surrounded by steep cliffs that provide homes for many seabirds. Lake Arcturus, a salt-water, crater lake, lies in the center of the island and contains sediment that is less than 6000 years old. No eruptions have ever been recorded for Genovesa, but there is evidence of young lava flows on the outskirts of the volcano.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>Genovesa has developed a reputation as “The Bird Island” because of the numerous and varied bird species that nest there. Visitors can explore two visitor sites and will be impressed with the abundance of frigatebirds, Nazca and Red-footed Boobies, Swallow-tailed Gulls, storm petrels, Red-billed Tropicbirds, finches, and mockingbirds, among other bird species. Genovesa is one of the few places in the Galapagos Islands where Red-footed Boobies are found en masse. The marine iguanas found along the shoreline are the only reptile on Genovesa and are the smallest in the archipelago.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>In March 2003, Ladybird Beetles (Rodolia cardinalis) were released on Genovesa to control the invasive cottony cushion scale, which is detrimental to many native plants. Genovesa was one of the last of the Galapagos Islands to undergo this form of biological control.</p>
      <p>On the dinghy ride to and from the Prince Philip’s Steps visitor site, named for Prince Philip who visited Galapagos in 1965 and again in 1981, visitors will marvel at the variety of sea life using the crevices of the lava cliffs for shelter. Red-billed Tropicbirds fly overhead, darting between their nests and the bay, and a small colony of fur seals may be found near the landing site. Visitors are dropped off at a steep stairway that begins on rocks at the foot of a path that leads through a seabird colony full of Nazca and Red-footed Boobies. Once visitors reach the plateau, the trail continues inland and passes more nesting booby colonies in the thin Palo Santo forest. Near the end of the trail, visitors can look out over a rocky lava plain where Wedge-rumped Storm Petrels fly in all directions. Unlike other petrels, these birds are unique because they are active during daytime and return to their nests in the evening to avoid their predators. Lucky visitors with keen eyes may catch a glimpse of a Short-eared Owl stalking its petrel prey along the island’s eastern cliffs.</p>
      <p>Visitors disembark at Darwin Bay Beach onto a small sand and coral beach. A short trail heads west along a tidal lagoon and then up a rocky hill that leads to a point overlooking the cliffs and Darwin Bay. Along the trail near the tidal lagoon, visitors will see pairs of Swallow-tailed Gulls—the only nocturnal gull species in the world—Lava Gulls, and Yellow-crowned and Lava Herons. The trail continues through Palo Santo trees, Opuntia cacti, and Saltbushes inhabited by Great Frigatebirds and Red-footed Boobies. Visitors are asked to watch where they walk, so as not to step on any Swallow-tailed Gull eggs. This is one of the few places in the islands where visitors are guaranteed to see Red-footed Boobies, with their bright red prehensile feet and contrasting blue bills. Red-footed Boobies are the smallest of the three booby species in Galapagos, and two plumage forms can be found: 95% of the birds have brown feathers and the other 5% have white feathers. It is estimated that more than 200,000 Red-footed Boobies live in the trees and bushes of Genovesa.</p>
      <p>Visitors can snorkel along the cliffs at Prince Philip’s Steps, at Darwin Beach or anywhere along the cliffs inside the caldera. The water is very nutrient-rich, so all types of marine life can be found. Numerous shark species are present, with hammerheads the most abundant. Sea lions, sea turtles, and the occasional Manta Ray can also be seen.</p>

        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>The seahorse-shaped Isabela Island was originally named Albemarle Island for the Duke of Albemarle by Ambrose Cowley, one of the first men to ever set foot on the islands, in 1684. It is the largest of all the islands, measuring 120 km long and greater in size than all of the other islands combined. Tagus Cove on the northwestern side of the island provided a sheltered anchorage for pirates, buccaneers, whalers, and others. Darwin visited Tagus Cove in 1835. In 1893, Antonio Gil, a well-known Guayaquileño, arrived in Galapagos and after visiting the other islands, colonized southern Isabela, founding the town of Puerto Villamil on the southern coast and later Santa Tomás in the highlands. He named Villamil after the freedom fighter from Guayaquil, José de Villamil. Villamil began as a center for a lime production operation where they burned coral collected in the coastal waters. Santa Tomás was the center for a sulfur mine in the caldera and a nearby coffee plantation. The ventures were only somewhat profitable due to water limitations. By 1906, Santa Tomás had a population of 200 people who depended primarily on the wild livestock ranging the slopes of Sierra Negra and on the exploitation of sulfur. By 1974 there were nearly 450 residents on Isabela. This number has increased in each official census, with the total in the 2006 census reaching 1749.</p>
        <h4 class="">Geology</h4>
        <p>One of the younger islands, Isabela Island was formed by the joining of six shield volcanoes — from north to south — Ecuador, Wolf, Darwin, Alcedo, Sierra Negra, and Cerro Azul. All of the volcanoes except Ecuador are still active. The western flanks of Ecuador Volcano have collapsed. Wolf Volcano, with an elevation of 1707 m, is the highest point in the Galapagos Archipelago. Both Wolf and Ecuador Volcanoes lie directly on the equator. Isabela is one of the more volcanically active islands. Eruptions have been recorded in the last fifty years for Wolf Volcano (1963 and 1982), Alcedo (1993), Sierra Negra (1963, 1979, and 2005), and Cerro Azul (1959, 1979, 1998, and 2008). Isabela provides visitors with excellent examples of the geologic forces that created the Galapagos Islands, including uplifts at Urbina Bay, tuff cones at Tagus Cove, and pumice on Alcedo Volcano.</p>
        <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>The majority of Isabela residents make their living by fishing, farming, and tourism. The center of population is on the southern coast at Puerto Villamil. Unlike the other large islands, the vegetation zones on Isabela do not follow the normal pattern. There are many relatively new lava fields and the surrounding soils have not developed sufficient nutrients to support the varied life zones found on other islands. In addition, the high elevations of Wolf and Cerro Azul Volcanoes reach above the cloud cover, resulting in an arid zone at the top of the island. The island’s rich fauna is beyond compare. It is home to more wild tortoises than all the other islands combined, with a separate species on each volcano. On the west coast of Isabela the upwelling of the nutrient-rich Cromwell Current creates a feeding ground for fish, whales, dolphins, and birds. These waters have long been known as the best place to see whales in the Galapagos. Some 16 species of whales have been identified in the area including humpbacks, sperms, sei, minkes and orcas.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>The immense size of Isabela increases the various conservation challenges found on other islands. Eradication of introduced species on an island this size can be extremely costly, as demonstrated during Project Isabela when successful eradication of goats and donkeys in northern Isabela was achieved. The continued presence of cats and rats on the island are causing problems for some of the more endangered and vulnerable birds, as well as snakes and other small reptiles. Of greatest concern is the survival of the mangrove finch, with a population of only 100 birds. Isabela has also been the center of much of the fishing controversies over the last two decades. Sea cucumber fishing was focused primarily in the nutrient-rich waters of the western coast of Isabela, especially the channel between Isabela and Fernandina. Although there have been many advances in fisheries management during the past ten years and much of the conflict is reduced or non-existent, achieving sustainability in marine ecosystems where fishing is permitted is still a work in progress.</p>
      <p>Villamil is the most beautiful townsite in Galapagos, with its long, white-sand, palm-lined beaches and several brackish-water lagoons frequented by pink flamingoes, common stilts, whimbrels, white-cheeked pintails, and gallinules. The majority of Isabela’s residents live in the port town of Villamil. Until recently, the population was primarily involved in fishing and agriculture and had little connection to tourism. Then in the 1990s, development for tourism began in earnest. A small airport was completed in 1996 for inter-island flights. The number of hotels grew from a single hotel in 1980, to three in 1990, to 13 hotels by 2006. The number of bars and restaurants has grown from only two in 1980 and 1990 to 18 in 2006. However, the town still retains its relaxed attitude in contrast to Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on San Cristóbal. There are several visitor sites accessible from town by car, foot, and dinghy.</p>
      <p>Sierra Negra Volcano is one of the most impressive examples of a volcano in the archipelago. Its caldera measures 10 km across from north to south and 9 km from east to west, and is considered to be the second largest caldera in the world. Visits to Sierra Negra require a 45-minute drive from Villamil followed by several hours of walking or horseback riding. The primary and easier-to-reach visitor site is Volcán Chico on the northeast corner of the volcano. Volcán Chico is a fissure of a parasitic cone that last erupted in November 1979. There visitors can walk on relatively recent lava flows. The site provides incredible vistas of the volcanoes of Isabela as well as Fernandina. At the other end of the caldera visitors who want to make a longer trek can view a system of fumaroles, known as the Sulfur Mine. Sulfur in the form of crystals has been deposited on the fumaroles for thousands of years.</p>
      <p>Four visitor sites are easily accessible from Puerto Villamil — Villamil Lagoons, Tortoise Center, Wall of Tears, and Tintoreras. The first three are accessible by foot while a panga ride is required to reach Tintoreras. An interpretive trail runs from town, through the Lagoons, and ends at the Tortoise Center, approximately 1.5 km from town. The beach and lagoons near Villamil are the best sites in the archipelago to view migratory birds. Black-necked stilts and flamingoes are two of the most common resident species.</p>

      <h3 class="">Marchena</h3>
      <ul class="islandinfo">
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> 130km<sup>2</sup> or 50mi<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Maximum Altitude:</strong> 343m or 1125ft</li>
      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Marchena Island is the largest of the northern islands. The Marchena Lava Lizard is endemic to that island. On the southwest coast there is a large series of grottos and coves that are frequented by fur seals. Although the majority of current day volcanic eruptions in Galapagos occur in the westernmost islands of Fernandina and Isabela, Marchena experienced an eruption in 1991, the first recorded on that island for at least 100 years. Marchena also played a small role in the fascinating human history of Floreana. In 1934, the body of Lorenz, one of the consorts of the Baroness, was found mummified on the beach at Marchena, along with Nuggeröd, the owner of the small fishing boat Dinamita.</p>
        <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>With no terrestrial visitor sites, Marchena is rarely visited by anyone, including scientists and park wardens. The two programs carried out on Marchena in recent decades include two eradication programs – for goats and the little fire ant. Two marine visitor sites exist – Punta Espejo on the southeast and Punta Mejía on the southwest.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>The primary conservation challenges on Marchena have involved introduced species, first feral goats and later the Little Fire Ant. Goats were first released onto Marchena around 1967. The goat eradication program ran from 1970 to 1979, when the island was declared free of goats. During the Project Isabela years, goats were once again found on Marchena but quickly eliminated by park rangers. Judas goats were then released on Marchena as well as other islands to ensure that any potential introduction could be dealt with rapidly. The Little Fire Ant was first found in Marchena in 1988. An eradication program eventually reduced the size of the known infestation. However recent surveys have found an even larger area of infestation. A key concern for Marchena is the possibility of the further introductions of these or other aggressive exotic species.</p>
      <p>Punta Espejo on the southeast edge of Marchena is an excellent site for sharks, with Hammerhead and Galapagos Sharks particularly abundant. Dolphins and sea lions are also present. Other species include sea turtles, rays, Moray Eels, and Garden Eels, among others. Bats can also sometimes be observed on the sand. A second dive site, Punta Mejía, is located on the southwestern side of the island. Rays, eels, and many fish species can be observed there.</p>
      <p>The Little Fire Ant was first found in Marchena in 1988. An eradication program eventually reduced the size of the known infested area. By 2002 and up to 2007, no fire ants were detected. However in 2007, evidence of the presence of fire ants was observed. A survey in 2008 indicated that a much larger area is infested. The GNP is planning a more thorough survey in the first quarter of 2009 to determine the exact extent of the problem.</p>

        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Named after the English nobleman Lord Hugh Seymour, North Seymour was formed by a series of uplifts of submarine lava along with Baltra (also called South Seymour) and the northeastern part of Santa Cruz, resulting in flat plateaus. In the early 1930s, members of the Hancock Expeditions moved approximately 70 land iguanas from Baltra Island to North Seymour in order to provide better conditions for their survival, as introduced goats were destroying the habitat on Baltra and contributing to their declining population. Land iguanas are not native to North Seymour Island.</p>
        <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>North Seymour is now home to nearly 2,500 land iguanas, according to a 2014 census by the Galapagos National Park (GNP). This island also hosts large populations of blue-footed boobies, swallow-tailed gulls, common noddies, and frigatebirds.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Introduced rats were eradicated from the island as a pilot project prior to the rat eradication campaigns on Pinzón and Rábida Islands. However, rats may eventually repopulate North Seymour, swimming from Baltra to Mosquera to North Seymour.</p>
      <p>At 120 meters by 600 meters, this small, flat, sandy islet sits in the channel between Baltra and North Seymour and is almost devoid of vegetation. It has one of the largest populations of sea lions and its sandy expanses offer visitors the perfect opportunity to observe sea lion behavior. It is also a beautiful site to observe lava gulls, coastal birds, and Sally lightfoot crabs.</p>
      <p>There are three dive sites around North Seymour, along the line from the northeast corner of Baltra to Mosquera, from Mosquera north to the southeast corner of North Seymour, and in the northeast zone of North Seymour. All of these sites provide good opportunities to observe sea lions, large schools of fishes, some sharks, rays, and sea turtles.</p>

      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Pinta Island is the northernmost of the larger islands and is relatively isolated from the rest of the archipelago. Originally named for the Earl of Abingdon, the island’s official Ecuadorian name is Isla Pinta, named after one of the three ships sailed to the New World by Columbus. Pinta is a shield volcano with numerous young cones and lava flows along NNW-trending fissures. Pinta is the original home of Lonesome George, perhaps the most famous tortoise in the world. During the 1800s, whalers removed large numbers of Pinta tortoises as a food resource on their long journeys. By the early 20th century, the Pinta tortoise was likely ecologically extinct. Fishermen also opportunistically slaughtered tortoises through the mid 1900s. Goats were introduced to Pinta in 1959 and a subsequent population explosion caused massive ecosystem degradation. The sole known surviving Pinta tortoise, Lonesome George, was spotted in 1971 and taken into captivity the following year; no other live tortoise has been found since. For more than 35 years, Lonesome George has remained at the Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz, where he can be seen today.</p>
        <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>Pinta has long been home to Swallow-tailed Gulls, marine iguanas, Galapagos Hawks, fur seals, and a number of other unique bird, reptile, and plant species. Until the mid-19th century, it was also home to thousands of Pinta tortoises—giant saddleback tortoises endemic to this island. Today it stands as a sober reminder of the destructive impact of humans on fragile ecosystems. However, a group of conservationists, scientists, and resource managers are working to restore Pinta. Used as a training ground for Project Isabela, the complete removal of goats in 1999 resulted in Pinta being one of the islands with almost no exotic species, although it continues to lack its largest species, the giant tortoise. Project Pinta is aimed at restoring the giant tortoise to this island and thus restoring the ecosystem.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>With the explosion of the goat population following the release of goats on Pinta in 1959, the vegetation and forest habitats on Pinta went through a long period of degradation. Goat numbers were greatly reduced in the 1970s, but complete eradication was not achieved until 1999, when Pinta was used as a training ground for Project Isabela. Fortunately, it appears that the intense grazing pressure by goats was stopped before any of Pinta’s plant species became extinct and the vegetation recovered rapidly in the absence of goats. There are indications, however, that some of the endemic plant species that require substantial light, such as the Darwin Aster, Galapagos Cotton, and Galapagos Passionflower, could be negatively affected by the unchecked regeneration of Pinta’s vegetation. Complete restoration of Pinta requires the presence of giant tortoises. Giant tortoises have a major impact on the structure and composition of their environment. They can maintain open areas within forests and dense vegetation by grazing and by simply moving through their environment. They also play an important role in the dispersal and germination of seeds that they consume and subsequently deposit.</p>
      <p>Punta Neros is the only visitor site located near Pinta. There are no land visitor sites. It is located at the very northernmost point of the island. Highlights include the Red-lipped Batfish areas with a sandy substrate, sea lions, sea turtles, pelagic fish species, and Moray Eels. Although diversity is not as high as elsewhere, abundance of fishes is very high.</p>
      <p>In an extraordinary effort spearheaded by the Galapagos National Park (GNP) and the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF), the restoration of Pinta may soon become a reality. Project Pintarepresents the best efforts of conservationists to restore a degraded ecosystem and recover what was thought to be lost forever. Reclaiming Pinta through the reestablishment of a giant tortoise population represents a landmark conservation accomplishment that would be impossible without technologies and conservation tools developed in Galapagos over the last 40 years. Additional DNA analyses must still be completed to determine the possibility of reestablishing a pure Pinta tortoise, but the reintroduction of 39 sterilized hybrid tortoises to the Island in 2010 marked the first big step in restoring the landscape of Pinta.</p>

      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Pinzón Island, named for the brothers Pinzón, captains of the Pinta and the Niña on Columbus’ voyage to the New World, sits at the center of the archipelago. Surrounded by deep waters, Pinzón has remained isolated from all other islands for eons. The island is dominated by rocks, low spiny vegetation, and sparse tree growth. With a summit higher than most of the other arid Galapagos Islands, Pinzón experiences garúa, the heavy mist that occurs on the higher islands during the dry season. Because of this, many epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants, upon which they depend on for mechanical support but not for nutrients), including ferns and bromeliads, are found on Pinzón — even on Opuntia cactus.</p>
      <p>Common animals on Pinzón include Darwin’s finches, Galapagos doves, vermilion flycatchers, Galapagos snakes, and its own species of lava lizard and giant tortoise. The little fire ant is the only introduced species found throughout much of the island. Black rats plagued the island for over 100 years, essentially cutting off all natural recruitment into the tortoise population. Prior to the arrival of rats, the tortoises of Pinzón were nearly driven to extinction by whalers. Later scientific collecting expeditions continued the decimation of the population. The California Academy of Sciences collected some 80 tortoises off Pinzón in 1905. During World War II two airplanes out of the US Base at Baltra crashed on Pinzón and the remains of these aircraft can still be found today.</p>
        <h4 class="">Today</h4>
         <p>With no land or marine visitor sites, Pinzón is one of the least visited islands. The deep waters surrounding it are fished by local fishermen. The Pinzón tortoise project, which began in 1965, continues today.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>With the establishment of the Galapagos National Park Directorate and the Charles Darwin Research Station in 1959, a review of the tortoise populations was initiated. On Pinzón there were some 100-200 giant tortoises, all old adults. No young were found. Black rats, introduced to the island in the late 1800s, had apparently consumed all tortoise eggs and/or hatchlings for most of the 20th century. In 1965, the first eggs were brought from the natural tortoise nests on Pinzón and the tortoise rearing program was begun. Since the first 20 tortoises were repatriated to Pinzón in 1970, over 800 young tortoises have been released there.</p>
      <p>The first attempt to eradicate the black rats was carried out in 1988-89; after several months of not finding any rats, they eventually began to reappear indicating that the campaign was a failure. With new methodologies (mainly the systematic release of poisoned bait from a helicopter), a successful rat eradication campaign was carried out by the GNPD and its collaborators in December 2012. In December 2014, a tortoise survey on Pinzón indicated continued growth and survival of the repatriates, the ongoing presence of many of the original native tortoises, and, for the first time in over 100 years, substantial numbers of native-born hatchlings — indicating successful in situ reproduction.</p>
      <p>Data from a recent monitoring trip investigating the relative abundance of landbirds, seabirds, other reptiles and invertebrates are now being processed. A first look at the endemic land snail survey data indicates that native snails are generally more abundant and widely distributed across the island since the rat eradication.  </p>
     <p>To the south of Pinzón is No Name Rock, where visitors can scuba dive around the circumference of the islet. Hammerhead and Galapagos sharks can be seen here, and sometimes other pelagic species, including rays and sea turtles.</p>
        <p>Although black rats are now absent on Pinzón, thus allowing giant tortoises to successfully reproduce in situ, the Pinzón tortoise population will continue to be included in the rearing and repatriation program in order to rebuild the population more quickly. Although hatchling tortoises are successfully leaving the nests on Pinzón, their survival in the first years of life in the wild is relatively low, while those of tortoises reared in captivity to approximately four years old have a better long-term survival rate. It is expected that egg/hatchling collection trips will occur approximately every 4-5 years, allowing natural reproduction to occur in the intermediate years.</p>

      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Plazas Islands off the east coast of Santa Cruz is made up of two small crescent-shaped islands, North Plaza and South Plaza. South Plaza Island has a visitor site, however North Plaza is only used for research purposes and is not open to visitors. South Plaza is one of the smallest islands with a visitor site in the archipelago and was formed from an uplifted seabed. Despite its small size, South Plaza is home to a wide variety of species and is famous for its extraordinary flora.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>It is believed that introduced mice were responsible (at least in part) for the decline in the cactus population, an important food source for land iguanas. Although the mice were eradicated in late 2012, an ongoing challenge is the long-term restoration of the cactus forest while maintaining a healthy land iguana population.</p>
      <p>South Plaza Island is a popular site among visitors. Red-billed tropicbirds and swallow-tailed gulls are some of the many birds that can be found nesting along the cliffs, and a large colony of land iguanas can be found on the island. The South Plaza land iguanas are the smallest in the archipelago. Marine iguanas are also abundant, and an occasional hybrid between a marine iguana and a land iguana can be seen on the trail. Approximately 1,000 sea lions inhabit the island. South Plaza is also home to the beautiful succulent Sesuvium, which changes from bright green in the rainy season to red, orange, and purple during the dry season, and the landscape is dotted with prickly pear cactus trees.</p>

        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Sitting 4.5 km to the south of Santiago Island, Rábida Island is one of the most volcanically varied islands in the archipelago. Originally named for the 18th-century British admiral John Jervis, the island’s official Ecuadorian name is Isla Rábida, named after the convent of Rábida, where Columbus left his son during his voyage to the Americas. In the Galapagos literature, the description of the various giant tortoise populations often describe a population for Rábida. A tortoise specimen was collected by the California Academy of Sciences in 1905; however, there was some evidence that this tortoise was from southern Isabela and recent genetic analyses confirm this.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Rábida is a relatively small, arid island with steep slopes. Most of the coastline is rocky except for a beach on the northeast side. Several small volcanic craters and the high amount of iron in the lava give the island its distinctive red color and overall appearance.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Goats were introduced to Rábida twice, first around 1971 and then again prior to 1975. The first group of four animals was eradicated in 1971 and the second group of 10 animals was eliminated between 1975 and 1977. Since then, the island has remained goat-free.</p>
      <p>Today, the main conservation challenge is the presence of introduced Norway Rats and perhaps Black Rats. Although the introduction date is unknown, it is believed that rats arrived on Rábida within the last half century. Rats have negative impacts on both native vegetation and birds and reptiles. Rábida has one Critically Endangered plant species (Galvezia leucantha pubescens), which may be affected by the rats.</p>
        <p>An international workshop on rodent eradication, held in Galapagos in 2007, resulted in the development of a rodent eradication plan for Pinzón and Rábida Islands. In January of 2011, the Rat Eradication Project was implemented on Rábida. A successful eradication should result in the enhancement of both native flora and fauna. </p>
        <p>Around the northern tip of Rábida, divers can observe sea lions, sea turtles, Eagle Rays, Garden Eels, and occasionally sharks and penguins. There is also a small colony of fur seals.</p>

      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>~6000 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>San Cristóbal is the fifth largest and easternmost island of the Galapagos. It is comprised of three or four fused volcanoes, all extinct. Its name comes from the Patron Saint of seafarers, “St. Christopher.” Its older English name of Chatham is named after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. It is home to the oldest permanent settlement of the islands and is the island where Darwin first went ashore in 1835. El Junco, a small lake located near the top of the island, is the only source of permanent fresh water in the islands. This resource led to the early settlement of San Cristóbal, which was home to the islands’ governor when Darwin visited the archipelago in 1835. In 1858, Manuel Cobos and José Monroy formed the Orchillera Company to harvest orchilla moss (a lichen), which was used at that time as a dye. Cobos later formed an agricultural center called “El Progreso” inland from Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, which produced leather from feral cattle, and fish and tortoise oil. A penal colony was built on San Cristóbal Island in 1880 for prisoners from mainland Ecuador. This was eventually run by Cobos. By 1891, sugar cane plantations were established and a sugar factory was put into operation. Cobos ruled “El Progreso” with an iron fist, treating convicts as slaves. Cobos was assassinated by a group of his workers on January 15, 1904, and the prisoners escaped. A fishing company, called “The Predial” flourished from 1952 to 1960. The company stored fish in large refrigerators before shipping them to the continent. The business eventually fell into ruin due to its excessive costs.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>The town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on San Cristóbal is the capital of the Galapagos province. It is home to many government offices, an Ecuadorian Navy facility, and an airport with daily flights to the mainland. There are approximately 5,400 residents, making it home to the second largest human population in Galapagos, after Santa Cruz. The majority of inhabitants make their living in government, tourism, and artisanal fishing. The port town is home to the Galapagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences (GAIAS) of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito. This institution serves as a base of operation for local university students to carry out thesis work, and for international students to participate in semester abroad programs. The GNPS Interpretation Center is located near town and provides an excellent source of information for the local community and visitors.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Having a port town with an airport, San Cristóbal is especially susceptible to the potential of new introductions of exotic and sometimes aggressive species. Several of the more serious introductions have occurred first in San Cristóbal, including the black fly (Simulium bipunctata), which was introduced in 1990. This fly has caused problems for farmers in the highlands where it is most common. It sucks blood from both humans and farm animals, leaving a poison that in some cases has resulted in the death of animals. San Cristóbal also has some of the more aggressive introduced plants, including guayaba and blackberry. San Cristóbal is also home to the largest of the fishing fleets in Galapagos, represented by two separate fishing cooperatives. Fisheries and conservation have been at odds at times in the recent history of Galapagos; the challenge today is to work with the fishermen in establishing management strategies for the Marine Reserve that will conserve Galapagos biodiversity and provide a sustainable resource to a portion of the population.</p>
      <p>Founded by the colonist General Villamil in the mid-nineteenth century, the town was named after Alfredo Baquerizo Moreno, who in 1916 was the first Ecuadorian president to visit the islands. It is the second largest community in Galapagos, after Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz. The majority of the residents of San Cristóbal live in the port city. Puerto Baquerizo Moreno is the capital of the Galapagos province. It has two main streets, the Malecón Charles Darwin, which runs along the waterfront, where visitors can find restaurants, souvenir shops, and hotels. Parallel to it and a couple of blocks to the east is the main thoroughfare. From 1991 to 2006, the number of hotels in San Cristóbal increased from only 6 to 23. During the same period, the number of restaurants and bars increased from 9 to 35. Puerto Baquerizo Moreno has also become the focus of the Galapagos’ growing reputation among South Americans as a surfing hotspot. The waves are best at the beginning of the warm-wet season, when the water is warm enough not to need a wet suit. Tongo Reef, west of town, is one of the better places to surf.</p>
        <p>El Progreso is the oldest surviving settlement in the Galapagos, established in 1869. About 500 people live in this small farming community, located on the side of an extinct volcano about 8 km (5 mi) from Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. In the mid-1800s a penal colony was established there for prisoners from Ecuador. This was later taken over by Manuel Cobos who treated the convicts as slave laborers. Unsurprisingly, the convicts murdered Cobos during an insurrection. Today the town is a sleepy farming community.</p>
        <p>This coral sand beach is located about 10 minutes from the airport. A large number of sea lions rest in the sand and rocks along this coast. In addition to sea lions, birds such as Yellow Warblers, frigatebirds, and numerous species of finches can be seen.</p>

      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Volcanic activity has long since ceased on Santa Cruz, the second largest of the Galapagos Islands and located in the center of the archipelago. The name Santa Cruz is Spanish for “Holy Cross,” but its English name — Indefatigable — was named for the British vessel HMS Indefatigable. Santa Cruz has a long history of human settlement and agriculture, which has left the landscape permanently altered by invasive species. Human development began in the 20th century on Santa Cruz when settlers from the United States and Europe moved to the area between WWI and WWII. The variety of geology, wildlife, and vegetation attracted settlers. The small towns of Bellavista and Santa Rosa were established in the humid highlands, where farmers raised cattle and planted crops such as avocados, coffee, sugarcane, bananas, oranges, and lemons.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Santa Cruz is the main tourism hub for all of Galapagos, given its proximity to the airport on Baltra to the north. It is the only island in Galapagos where tourists can readily experience the interior and higher elevations of a Galapagos island. Santa Cruz has the longest paved road in Galapagos, which runs north-south across the island, taking people from the airport ferry at Itabaca Canal on the north coast into the highlands and through a few smaller towns on its way down to Puerto Ayora, the island’s largest city located on the southern coast of the island in Academy Bay.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>The Galapagos Islands have experienced accelerated development due to recent rapid growth in both tourism and population. Santa Cruz Island, and more specifically the town of Puerto Ayora, has withstood the brunt of this growth. In addition to the problem of introduced species and the ever-greater probability of introductions, this growth has put increasing pressures on local resources and municipalities in terms of health, education, waste management, and many other aspects of daily life. For example, until recently, the waste produced by the community was taken to a dump where no treatment was performed. In 2006, through the joint efforts of the community and the Galapagos National Park, the “Fabricio Valverde Environmental Center” was established outside of Puerto Ayora to provide recycling of 40% of the waste materials generated in Santa Cruz.</p>
      <p>Situated in Academy Bay on the southern coast of Santa Cruz, Puerto Ayora is a port town where sailboats fill the bay, sea birds fill the air, and marine iguanas dot the shore. Puerto Ayora is the heart and soul of the Galapagos Islands’ human population and is the main tourism hub in the archipelago.</p>
        <p>Known for its quaint hotels with creative architecture and small restaurants with delicious seafood, Puerto Ayora is the base point for most tours and offers the most services in Galapagos, including a hospital, banks, post office, radio station and a TAME airline office. Most travelers to the Galapagos will make a stop in Puerto Ayora during their trip.</p>
        <p>Puerto Ayora also offers the most options for tourists who prefer to sleep ashore. There are a variety of day tours available allowing visitors to design their own Galapagos experience. Day-trips to a number of the islands, kayaking, tours of the highlands, hiking, dive trips, mountain biking, and horseback riding are just a few of the activities visitors can arrange in Puerto Ayora. It is also home to the headquarters of the Galapagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Research Station (see visitor site).

      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Santa Fe Island, also called Barrington Island after British Admiral Samuel Barrington, is a small, relatively flat island at the center of the Archipelago, to the southeast of Santa Cruz Island. Geologically, it is one of the oldest volcanoes, with rock formations below the surface of the water that date back 3.9 million years. There is strong evidence that giant tortoises were once native to Santa Fe. At least two accounts of whaling vessels removing tortoises from Santa Fe exist and two informants to the California Academy of Sciences expedition in 1905-06 told of tortoises having been on Santa Fe. Current genetic analyses of the bone fragments collected by the California Academy suggest that the Santa Fe tortoise was a unique tortoise taxon, most closely related to the Española tortoise (Chelonoidis hoodensis). The vegetation of the island is characterized by the presence of a dense forest of the largest species of giant Opuntia cactus.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Santa Fe is home to two species endemic to the island: the Santa Fe Land Iguana (Conolophus pallidus) and the Santa Fe Rice Rat (Oryzomys bauri). The land iguana population was recently estimated to have 6,500-7,000 individuals. It is also the site of the longest running research project on marine iguanas, begun in the late 1970s. There is a single visitor site on land and three marine sites around the island.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>The greatest challenge on Santa Fe is to ensure that no invasive species become established. Of particular concern is the potential arrival of introduced rats. On all islands except for Santiago, the endemic rice rat became extinct following the arrival and establishment of the invasive Black Rat. Regular monitoring of the endemic rat population is critical, along with regular checks for the arrival of introduced rats. Goats were introduced to Santa Fe sometime prior to 1905. These were finally eliminated (over 3,000 animals) between 1964 and 1972, with the last three goats removed in 1974. The vegetation of Santa Fe recovered slowly until the El Niño of 1982-83, when excessive rainfall resulted in near complete recovery. The Little Fire Ant was discovered and eradicated in 1975 and again in 1988. Periodic checks are critical to ensure that this aggressive species never gets reestablished on this small island.</p>
      <p>At the international workshop on giant tortoises in 2012, the decision was made to pursue the return of giant tortoises to Santa Fe. A thorough review of the literature and the genetics of the few museum fragments from Santa Fe tortoises, as well as an evaluation of the status of the tortoise population on Española Island, resulted in a decision by the Galapagos National Park Directorate to restore giant tortoises on Santa Fe using an analog or substitute species – the Española tortoise. After building exclosures in the tortoise release area to later evaluate the impact of tortoises on the vegetation, the first release of 201 young Española tortoises (ranging in age from 4-10 years) was completed in June 2015. Annual releases of juvenile tortoises are planned for the next ten years.</p>
        <p>The visit begins with a wet landing on the small beach in Barrington Bay on the northeast side of the island. Large numbers of sea lions are found on the beaches in the bay and can often be seen surfing in the waves. There are two trails, one short loop that is fairly close to the beach and provides a close-up look at the massive Santa Fe Opuntia cactus. Santa Fe land iguanas as well as Galapagos hawks are often seen along the visitor trail. The second trail climbs a steep cliff, providing a view of the inland section of the island.</p>
        <p>There are three dive sites on the north and east sides of Santa Fe. Sea lions are the principal attraction at all three sites. Fish densities are fairly low but there are occasional sightings of sea turtles and various species of rays. Galapagos sharks are also often seen at the East Coast (Costa Este).</p>

      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Santiago, originally named James Island after England’s King James II, was the second of the Galapagos Islands visited by Charles Darwin. The Beagle arrived there on October 5, 1835. There they found a party of Spaniards who had come from Charles Island to dry fish and salt tortoise meat. About 6 mi inland they discovered two men living in a hovel, who were employed catching tortoises. Santiago had long been a source of water, wood, and tortoises for buccaneers and whalers, as well as Captain Porter of the USS Essex from 1812-1814. The Spaniards showed Darwin and his group the salt mine, now a visitor site. Darwin’s record of land iguanas is the only one that indicates there was a thriving population, as today land iguanas are extinct on Santiago. In The Voyage of the Beagle, Darwin wrote, “I cannot give a more forcible proof of their numbers, than by stating that when we were left at James Island, we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our single tent.”</p>
    <p>During the 1920s and again in the 1960s, companies extracted salt from the Salt Mine Crater. They constructed roads and buildings at Puerto Egas, named for Hector Egas, the owner of the company that worked there in the 1960s. In the 1930s, a small group of people tried to colonize the island but ultimately failed. Their story is told in the book The Enchanted Islands: A Five-year Adventure in the Galapagos by Ainslie and Frances Conway. Goats, pigs, and donkeys were released on Santiago in the 1800s, causing havoc for the island ecosystem and many of its native species.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Santiago is visited by the majority of tourist boats with wonderful visitor sites at James Bay on the northwest and Sullivan Bay on the southeast. Puerto Egas at the south end of James Bay provides one of the best opportunities for visitors to see the Galapagos fur seal. The focus of conservation work on Santiago in the last decade has resulted in rapid recovery of much of the vegetation and many of the native species. However, the presence of introduced plants and black rats continue to cause problems within the natural ecosystem. Santiago also has several satellite islands, especially in the southeastern side of the island. Two of these, Bartolomé and Chinese Hat, are visitor sites, while others provide excellent dive sites.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Of the uninhabited islands, Santiago’s history of introductions and exploitation of natural resources is most similar to the inhabited islands. This is, in part, because of the companies mining salt there in the 1920s and the attempt at colonization in the 1930s. However, it began long before that with the exploitation of giant tortoises and the introduction of goats, pigs, donkeys, rats, and mice. Introduced plants, some arriving with the colonization attempts, have also spread throughout the island. By the establishment of the Galapagos National Park in 1959, the giant tortoise population of Santiago had been reduced to some 500 animals, with a predominance of males. Nesting was generally unsuccessful due to predation by pigs. The Santiago tortoises were soon included in the tortoise rearing and repatriation program; rock walls were also built around their natural nests to protect them from pigs.</p>
      <p>Over decades goats destroyed the natural woodlands, creating grasslands across the higher elevations of the island. Pigs systematically destroyed nests of many of the native species, including giant tortoises, sea turtles, and Galapagos petrels, among others. Attempts at goat and pig control were carried out by the Galapagos National Park beginning in the 1980s. However, it was not until more modern eradication technologies were applied as part of Project Isabela that complete eradication of goats, pigs, and donkeys was achieved. The island was declared pig-free in 2000, and goat- and donkey-free in 2006. The restoration of the vegetation is rapidly occurring, although there is now a problem with some of the introduced plant species that had been held in check by the goats.</p>
        <p>Galapagos rails have also made a comeback in the highlands and nesting of native species is more successful. For decades it was believed that on all islands with black rats, the endemic rice rat had gone extinct. However, a remnant population of rice rats was discovered on Santiago in 1997. The challenge today is to ensure that this population continues to survive in spite of the presence of black rats.</p>

      <h3 class="">Wolf</h3>
      <ul class="islandinfo">
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> 2.85km<sup>2</sup> or 1.1mi<sup>2</sup></li>

      <li><strong>Human Population:</strong>0 </li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="">History</h4>
      <p>Wolf Island (also known as Wenman Island) was named after the German geologist Theodor Wolf. It is located some 100 miles NW of Isabela on the Wolf-Darwin volcanic ridge. Darwin and Wolf Islands are the most remote in the archipelago. The first terrestrial visit took place in 1964 with the aid of a helicopter. Both Wolf and Darwin are the remaining tips of a massive, mostly subsurface volcano that rises over 1000 m above the sea floor. Now extinct, it is estimated to be from 400,000 to 1.6 million years old.</p>
      <h4 class="">Today</h4>
      <p>Wolf is inhabited only by sea birds and is rarely visited by tourists other than master divers. There is no terrestrial visitor site on the island. The main attraction of this tiny island is the dive site known as El Derrumbe. It is well-known among divers for its diverse and abundant marine wildlife. Because of the cold currents, the Great Spotted Whale Shark, various species of whales, and Hammerhead, White-tipped, and Galapagos Sharks are often seen. While many seabirds frequent the cliffs of the island, the most famous resident is the vampire finch.</p>
      <p>The same species as the Sharp-beaked Ground Finch (Geospiza difficilis), on Wolf Island these birds have developed a curious and perhaps a bit repugnant behavior – drinking the blood of the Nazca and Red-footed Boobies and other birds that nest on the island. The climate on Wolf is extremely dry most of the year and the seeds that are produced in the brief periods of rain are quickly eaten by the finches. To survive the long dry spells, the finches developed this extraordinary behavior. They peck the skin of the booby at the base of their feathers with their very sharp beaks until they draw blood. Other finches line up behind the booby and as soon as one leaves another takes its place.</p>
          <p>It is theorized that this behavior evolved from the pecking behavior used to eat parasites that live within the plumage. Curiously their feeding does not appear to harm the boobies. The vampire finch also feeds on booby eggs, as well as the lubricating fluids released by the boobies when they lay the eggs. However, some finches are not strong enough to crack the eggs, so they roll them until they fall and crack.</p>
      <h4 class="">Conservation Challenges</h4>
      <p>Given the great distance from the central islands, both Wolf and Darwin Islands are vulnerable to unregulated fishing and dive tourism. For this reason, the Galapagos National Park has recently established a permanent floating base at Wolf Island for patrolling these northern waters. </p>
      <p>Over decades goats destroyed the natural woodlands, creating grasslands across the higher elevations of the island. Pigs systematically destroyed nests of many of the native species, including giant tortoises, sea turtles, and Galapagos petrels, among others. Attempts at goat and pig control were carried out by the Galapagos National Park beginning in the 1980s. However, it was not until more modern eradication technologies were applied as part of Project Isabela that complete eradication of goats, pigs, and donkeys was achieved.
