        <h2><strong>To visit the Galapagos Islands is to experience a world before humans</strong></h2>
        <p>The things that make these islands special also make them fragile. Today, the Galapagos Islands are at risk due to a growing human population. Overuse of limited natural resources and constant introductions on invasive alien species and disease add stress to an isolated island system already beginning to experience the effects of global climate change.</p>
        <p>We at Galapagos Conservancy cannot imagine a world without the magic of Galapagos’ unique plants and animals. Generations to come deserve to know these islands and the diversity of wildlife that calls them home.</p>
        <p>Galapagos Conservancy funds ground-breaking conservation research, works closely with local communities, and promotes hands-on conservation work. We:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Bring together scientists, local organizations, and decision makers to collaborate on projects that respond to the greatest conservation needs.</li>
            <li>Provide essential funding to large-scale island-wide efforts, such as Project Pinta (returning tortoises to Pinta Island after an absence of 40 years), Project Isabela (eradicating large invasive mammals from the islands of Santiago and Isabela) and Project Floreana (restoring the natural environment while improving the quality of life for all of its inhabitants — humans, animals, plants, and marine species.</li>
            <li>Design and carry out projects with the Charles Darwin Foundation, the Galapagos National Park Service, and other conservation and management organizations in Galapagos that promote biodiversity conservation and strengthen civil society.</li>

        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
        <p>The year 2007 was a watershed in many ways, in terms of international, national and local discussions related to the many challenges associated with Galapagos conservation.</p>
        <p>In April of 2007, the President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, declared the Galapagos Islands “at risk” and their protection a national priority through Emergency Decree 207. President Correa made this announcement during a visit of a United Nations delegation (UNESCO) which was to determine whether the archipelago should be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. The decree called for a variety of immediate conservation measures including the restriction of some tourism permits, the return of individuals with “irregular” residency to the mainland, finding a comprehensive plan to control the spread of invasive species, implementing educational reform, and ensuring the development of sustainable businesses.</p>
        <p>Despite Correa’s call to action, on June 26, 2007 the World Heritage Committee recommended that Galapagos be added to UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger in hopes of rallying support for their conservation.  The 2007 Mission Report to the World Heritage Committee identified 15 issues needing urgent attention. These were later grouped into the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Prevention and control of Invasive Species</li>
            <li>Elimination of illegal fisheries and measures to make legal fisheries more sustainable</li>
            <li>Control, as outlined in the Special Law for Galapagos, of immigration and residency</li>
            <li>Measures to develop local capacity through improved education</li>
            <li>Greater transparency, accountability and efficiency in governance and regional planning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In July 2010, the World Heritage Committee decided to remove Galapagos from the List of World Heritage in Danger, citing significant progress made by Ecuador in addressing the problems identified in its 2007 report. The 2010 UNESCO Mission Report describes progress and remaining issues in detail.</p>

        <h2 id="invasive">Invasive Species</h2>
        <p>Controlling invasive species was among the most pressing challenges identified by the World Heritage Committee when it recommended that Galapagos be placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger.</p>
        <p>Scientists and conservationists agree that introduced plants and animals represent the single greatest threat to the terrestrial ecosystems of Galapagos. Since the discovery of Galapagos in 1535, humans have brought many alien species to the islands—some intentionally, including goats, pigs, cats, and both ornamental and food plants (vegetables and fruits), to name a few—while others, including rodents, insects, and weedy plants, have been carried to the islands accidentally.</p>
        <p>The good news is that 95% of the archipelago’s native species remain intact today, due in large part to the islands’ remoteness and relatively recent discovery and settlement by humans. However, it is the islands’ isolation that makes the native plants and animals so vulnerable to new arrivals. Separated from many of the species on the continent, the native plant and animals species of Galapagos evolved and thrived in a world with little predation or competition.</p>
        <p>While introduced species have been known to cause devastation to native flora and fauna throughout the world, and certainly in Galapagos, the threat from exotics in the marine environment is a more recent phenomenon and remains unstudied in Galapagos. The continuing increase in oceanic traffic, including increases in inter-island traffic related to Galapagos tourism, the number of cargo and other ships moving back and forth from the continent, the number of trans-oceanic and regional vessels using the waters around Galapagos, and the number of private vessels traveling through the islands, greatly increases the threat of hull and anchor transport of potentially invasive marine species. The successful establishment of introduced marine species elsewhere in the world has resulted in the complete restructuring of marine communities.</p>
        <p>The number of introduced species in Galapagos continues to increase, with many of them impacting the native ecosystems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A total of 36 vertebrate species have been introduced to Galapagos, with 30 of them becoming established, including 1 freshwater fish, 2 amphibians (frogs), 4 reptiles (all geckos), 10 birds, and 13 mammals. Most of the more invasive and devastating species are mammals, primarily goats, rats, cats, pigs, and dogs. The birds include domestic chickens and ducks, the semi-domestic Rock Pigeon, and wild species such as Smooth-billed Anis and Cattle Egrets.</li>
            <li>Some 750 introduced plant species have been registered in Galapagos, with nearly 90% of them brought deliberately by humans for agricultural and ornamental purposes. The recent jump in the total number of introduced plants is more a result of increased interest in the problem coupled with more thorough surveys than of any exponential increase in the introduction rate. The majority of introduced plants are not overly invasive. The most invasive species are primarily found only on the inhabited islands and Santiago.
    </li>
            <li>Approximately 543 alien insect species, more than 1/4 of the total insect fauna, have been registered in Galapagos. Most arrive in Galapagos on lumber, fruits and vegetables, and other organic material. The most serious threats to the Galapagos biota include two fire ant species (impact native invertebrates, reptiles, and birds), two wasp species (prey on native invertebrates and compete for food with finches), a scale insect (threatens many native plants), and an ectoparasitic fly (feeds on and harms nestlings of many bird species). Some of these also cause havoc for the human population.</li>
            <li>While not yet a problem, the threat from the potential arrival and establishment of aggressive marine species, such as the north Pacific sea star Asterias amurensi and the barnacle Chthamalus proteus, among others, is cause for concern.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Efforts to combat invasive species</h4>
        <p>Since the establishment of the Galapagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) in 1959, efforts to control and eradicate invasive introduced species have been on-going. Initial efforts were primarily aimed at goat populations on the smaller islands and control of plants in the highlands of Santa Cruz. However, by the 1980s, the increase in tourism and the resident population made stopping any new introductions of equal importance.</p>
        <p>The 1990s saw a major shift in invasive species work. The CDF played a lead role in establishing the Galapagos Inspection and Quarantine System (SICGAL), responsible for inspection of cargo from ships and planes, as well as the bags and luggage of tourists. Advances in eradication techniques worldwide provided the foundation for new and more expanded programs. Community education programs were implemented on the inhabited islands to increase both awareness of the threat from introduced species and participation by residents in the battle against invasives.</p>
        <p>Biological control—the use of natural enemies to reduce the damage caused by pest populations—was first used in Galapagos beginning in 2002, to control the cottony cushion scale, which was threatening more than 60 native and endemic plant species. After six years of intensive research to determine probability of success and any potential impacts, the Australian ladybug, Rodolia cardinalis, was released. This was the first intentional introduction of an insect to Galapagos and it has proven effective at reducing the scale population to manageable levels.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic success related to invasive species was achieved in March 2006, when Project Isabela—an unprecedented island restoration program in terms of size and scope—was completed, with the successful eradication of feral goats and donkeys from northern Isabela; goats, donkeys, and pigs from Santiago, and goats from Pinta.</p>
        <p>Additional successes include the eradication of fire ants from Marchena, rock pigeons from Galapagos (were only established on Isabela, Santa Cruz, and San Cristóbal), cats from Baltra, and one species of blackberry from much of Santa Cruz, among others.</p>

        <h3>The Endangered Jewels of Galapagos</h3>
        <p>The Galapagos flora and fauna, including the lumbering giant tortoises, the brightly colored land iguanas, foot-high penguins, flightless cormorants, the amazing complex of Scalesia plants, and many others, are the jewels of the archipelago and the dominant attraction for visitors. The status of both native and endemic species is a key determinant of research and management programs of the Galapagos National Park (GNP) and the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF). The listing of species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which is continually updated to reflect both positive and negative changes in the flora and fauna of the world, provides an up-to-date assessment of the status of each species for use by conservationists and managers in prioritizing their work. The endemic species of Galapagos are of the greatest conservation interest because their future depends entirely on their continued existence in the islands.</p>
        <p>While the number of species in an endangered category may change over time, the principal causes for extinction remain the same. They are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Habitat loss and or/ fragmentation</li>
            <li>Arrival of introduced species that are predators or disease vectors, or that compete for habitat or food</li>
            <li>Introduction of agents of infection, via air or sea, that pose a major risk factor that could lead to extinction of species, as occurred in Hawaii with the introduction of avian malaria</li>
            <li>Hunting, which although illegal in Galapagos can affect both reptiles and birds</li>
            <li>Increased tourism (without precautionary measures), population growth, and political-economic pressures</li>
            <li>Global warming and its large-scale impacts on natural processes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number of threatened and endangered species in Galapagos continues to increase as human activity continues to impact the island ecosystems. The status as of 2006-07 is as indicated below.</p>
        <p><strong>Vertebrate Species.</strong> In Galapagos, 109 endemic and native vertebrate species have been recorded, of which 13 are considered extinct. Seven of the extinct species are known from records of live specimens, while the other six are only known from the fossil record. The only species extinct in the wild is the giant land tortoise of Pinta, whose sole survivor, Lonesome George, died in 2012. The 95 extant species are listed as follows:</p>
        <ul class="">
            <li><strong>Critically Endangered</strong> – 7% – 3 reptiles (2 tortoises and 1 snake) and 4 birds (Mangrove finch, Galapagos petrel, Floreana mockingbird, and Galapagos albatross)</li>
            <li><strong>Endangered</strong> - 9% – 6 reptiles (2 snakes and 4 tortoises) and 3 birds (Flightless cormorant, Galapagos penguin, and San Cristóbal mockingbird)</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> – 23% – 11 reptiles, 6 birds, and 5 mammals (3 rice rats, Galapagos sea lion, and Galapagos fur seal)</li>
            <li><strong>Near Threatned</strong> -13% – 11 reptiles and 1 mammal</li>
            <li><strong>Least Concern</strong> - 46% – 42 birds and 2 mammals</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deficient</strong> – 1% – 1 bird</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Terrestrial invertebrate species.</strong> The evaluation of land invertebrates according to the IUCN Red List criteria was initiated in recent years, with the focus on endemic species. To date, the only groups evaluated are the Bulimulus land snails and the Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). Of the 103 species evaluated, 2 are already extinct, 26 are critically endangered, 9 are endangered, 26 are vulnerable, and 40 are apparently in no immediate danger of extinction. For all of these species, destruction and loss of habitat is the main threat. Many of them are especially sensitive to habitat alteration, which is prominent on the inhabited islands. Introduced species are the second greatest threat.</p>
        <p><strong>Plant species.</strong> The evaluation of the status of the flora of Galapagos has focused primarily on the 180 endemic species, given the large number of species and the importance of ensuring the survival of endemics. In 2006, a re-evaluation of the threat status of 171 species (the other 9 were considered data deficient) according to the categories of the IUCN showed that the number of threatened species is increasing. Of the 20 critically endangered species, all except 4 are restricted to the inhabited islands. The inhabited islands are undergoing severe ecological change and the primary threats are introduced species (especially goats and invasive plants) and habitat destruction or alteration. A comparison with the last evaluation in 2002 indicates a net movement of species from lower to higher threat categories. The current evaluation of 171 endemic plant species shows the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extinct</strong> – 3 (2%)</li>
            <li><strong>Critically Endangered</strong> – 20 (12%)</li>
            <li><strong>Endangered</strong> – 26 (15%)</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> – 54 (32%)</li>
            <li><strong>Near Threatened</strong> – 13 (8%)</li>
            <li><strong>Least Concern</strong> – 55 (32%)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Marine Species.</strong> Until recently, evaluation of marine species according to the IUCN Red List criteria focused on the more charismatic groups and those obviously impacted by human activity on a global scale, such as whales, pinnipeds, and more recently marine reptiles and sharks. In Galapagos, an evaluation of the many important subtidal, habitat-forming species, such as corals and macroalgae, was initiated in 2006 and a more inclusive fish evaluation in 2007. The primary threats to marine species are climatic events (especially strong El Niño events) and human activity (primarily overfishing). As of 2007, a total of 57 species were incorporated into the Red List (12 are considered Data Deficient). An additional 25 have been evaluated but the approval process for inclusion on the Red List has not yet been completed (includes 13 considered critically endangered, 3 endangered, and 9 vulnerable). The status of the 45 species on the Red List with sufficient data for categorization (includes 8 species included in the vertebrate list above) is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extinct</strong> – 0</li>
            <li><strong>Critically Endangered</strong> – 3 (6%)</li>
            <li><strong>Endangered</strong> – 3 (13%)</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> – 14 (31%)</li>
            <li><strong>Near Threatened</strong> – 5 (11%)</li>
            <li><strong>Least Concern</strong> – 17 (38%)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the establishment of the GNP and the CDF in 1959, efforts to protect and enhance populations of endangered native and endemic species have been on-going. Initial efforts were primarily aimed at the larger, more charismatic species such as giant tortoises. Protective fencing to exclude introduced goats and allow small areas of native vegetation to flourish was also begun in the early years. Key programs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Giant Tortoises</strong> - breeding, rearing, and repatriation; nest protection in the wild (against pigs)</li>
            <li><strong>Land Iguanas</strong> – breeding, rearing, and repatriation; cat control in nesting areas</li>
            <li><strong>Galapagos petrels</strong> – nest protection in the wild (against pigs, cats, and rats)</li>
            <li><strong>Flightless cormorants, Galapagos penguins, and flamingos</strong> – regular population censuses</li>
            <li><strong>Mangrove finch and Floreana mockingbird</strong> – new programs aimed at breeding, rearing, and repatriation</li>
            <li><strong>Endemic flora</strong> – protective fencing, eradication of introduced herbivores, reforestation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
        <h5>Current Initiatives to combat these problems: Ecosystem Restoration</h5>
        <p>While many of the species-specific programs have been ongoing, some for decades, both the GNP and the CDF are now focusing on ecosystem restoration as a way, not only of restoring disappearing ecological and evolutionary processes, but also of improving the status of many species at once. These programs are most often focused on entire islands. The Isabela Project (completed in 2006 and focused primarily on eradications of goats, pigs, and donkeys on Isabela and Santiago) was the first such project. Current projects include the Floreana Project, the Pinta Project, and the Pinzón Project. In general, the projects include eradication of invasive species, restoration of missing species (or their analog), and restoration of habitat.</p>

        <h2 id="poaching">Poaching</h2>
        <h3 >Poaching in the Galapagos Marine Reserve and Highlands Areas</h3>
        <p>The marine and terrestrial areas of the Galapagos National Park cover an area of 133,000 square kilometers (about the size of the state of Louisiana) making it very difficult for the Galapagos National Park Service (GNPS) and other authorities to monitor all human activity. Presently, poachers target a number of species in the Marine Reserve. There is also occasional evidence of tortoise poaching in the highland areas of the Park’s terrestrial reserves.</p>
        <h3>Illegal fisheries</h3>
        <p>Much of the illegal fishing that takes place in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) is done via longlining targeting sharks, tuna, and marlin. Longlining, a practice banned in the GMR, refers to the use of long monofilament fishing lines that can extend for miles, which have additional secondary lines and baited hooks extending down about 15 to 50 feet at regular intervals. In addition to catching target species, longlines often kill albatrosses—that see the baited hooks from the air and dive to eat the bait—as well as sea turtles, whales, and dolphins.</p>
        <p><strong>Sharks</strong> are a protected species in the GMR, but the high value of their fins, cartilage, teeth, and liver oil in Asian markets draws local, national, and international fishermen to their illegal harvest.  Reyes and Murillo (2007) estimated, based on the number of confiscated fins during the period, that at least 5,000 coastal pelagic sharks were killed in the GMR between 1997 and 2007. More than half of these fins were confiscated at sea, 19% at landing sites, and 14% at airports and in cargo ships.</p>
        <p><strong>Sea cucumbers,</strong> another Asian delicacy, are also targeted by poachers, although the drastic decline in their numbers due to overfishing has lessened illegal activity in this area. Out of the legal season, sea cucumbers are harvested in remote parts of the archipelago and are then sold to intermediaries from mainland Ecuador.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
        <h3>Efforts to patrol the Marine Reserve and prosecute poachers</h3>
        <p>The Galapagos National Park is responsible for the administration and management of the Galapagos Marine Reserve and coordinates patrolling activities within 40 nautical miles of the islands. The Ecuadoran Navy and other institutions assist in these activities. As of 2007, the Park’s Marine Control and Surveillance Unit had three ocean-going vessels for long range operations, two medium-range vessels and a number of smaller speed boats, manned by a total of about 50 crew members (30 fewer than needed).  An air unit and a new Satellite Vessel Monitoring System (SVMS) are now being used to track the position and speed of all large vessels traveling within the reserve. This technology has significantly increased the number of illegal fishing vessels captured in the GMR. The Park has also strengthened its legal team in order to better prosecute those found poaching in the GMR.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">   
        <h2 id="tourism">Tourism</h2>
        <p>Uncontrolled tourism and population growth was among the 15 issues identified by the World Heritage Committee when it recommended that Galapagos be placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger.</p>
        <p>Up until the early 1970s, residents numbered approximately 4,000. Between 1991 and 2007, the resident population more than doubled to more than 20,000. The population stands at just over 25,000 legal residents, 1,800 temporary residents and up to 5,000 residents whose status in Galapagos is characterized as “irregular.”</p>
        <p>Since its beginnings in the 1960s, tourism has been the most important factor contributing to population growth. Over the past 15 years, gross income generated by tourism has increased by an average of 14% each year. This growth is reflected in the increase in available beds (in both hotels and on tourist boats) from 1,928 in 1991 to 3,473 in 2006 and the rise in the number of visitors to Galapagos from 40,000 in 1990 to more than 145,000 in 2006. At present, Galapagos tourism generates $418M annually, of which an estimated $63M enters the local economy (equal to 51% of the Galapagos economy). The growth in tourism requires ever-increasing infrastructure and human resources. It has also resulted in the growth of local small enterprises, which, in turn, contribute to increased immigration.</p>
        <p>Other drivers of growth have included heavy government expenditures during Ecuador’s oil boom (1972-1983), a week economy in mainland Ecuador during the 1980s and 1990s, and a boom in the sea cucumber fishery (1993-2000). From 1999 to 2005, the population in Galapagos grew by 60%. During much of the 80s and 90s, the population was increasing at more than 6% per year, compared  to about 2% on the Ecuadorian mainland. This rate would double the population in Galapagos every 11 years. </p>
        <p>
    The Galapagos Special Law of 1998 laid out immigration protocols which sought to limit the size of the resident population. However, loopholes and incomplete and inconsistent implementation of the Law resulted in continued growth.</p>

    <div class="i-about">
        <h3>Impacts of population growth</h3>
        <p>In the larger protected areas and at visitor sites, the impact of increased numbers of visitors and residents has been fairly well managed through standard protected area management techniques, including trails, guides to accompany visitors, fixed itineraries, and a limited number of tourism concessions (MacFarland 2001). The Galapagos National Park Service monitors visitor sites and can close sites, increase necessary infrastructure such as stairs or walkways, or change itineraries in response to growing pressures.</p>
        <p>The impacts in the inhabited portions of the archipelago have been much more pronounced. Increasing numbers of visitors and residents have resulted in a rapid growth in physical infrastructure and ever-increasing demands for public services.</p>
        <p>As the human population in Galapagos has grown, the number of airports in the islands has increased from one to three, the number of flights from the continent have increased from a few flights per week in the 1970s to an average of six flights per day today, the number of cargo ships and the amount of cargo continue to increase, and increasingly more fuel is brought to the islands increasing the risk of oil spills such as that of the cargo ship Jessica in 2001. Commercial flights to Galapagos increased by 193% from 2001 to 2006 and more private flights are arriving from other countries (Cruz, Martínez and Causton, 2007). New access routes overcome natural barriers that protect the islands from the arrival of new species. Any increase in flights, new access routes, and cargo ships will potentially bring an increasing number of invasive species – the greatest threat to the archipelago. Invasive species links to the page focusing on that issue.</p>
        <p>Subsequent to the World Heritage Committee Mission Report in 2007, the Ecuadorian government under President Correa implemented a policy known as “Zero people on irregular status in Galapagos,” which involved the implementation of a system of Transit Control Cards for visitors, a more transparent process for granting permanent and temporary residency status, and penalties (such as a one-year ban from entering Galapagos) for those whose status in Galapagos is found to be “irregular.” In 2009, 263 irregular residents were returned to the mainland, 694 were informed of their irregular status, and 257 were banned from returning to Galapagos for a period of one year.</p>
        <p>While progress is being made in the area of population control, it is generally believed that the pressure for more illegal and temporary immigrants to help serve the tourism sector will continue until tourism is better managed and more efforts are made to build the capacity of the local workforce.</p>

    <div class="i-about">
        <h3>Protecting Galapagos through Biosecurity</h3>
        <p>Biosecurity involves the application of policies and systems to protect a specific area or population from biological harm. Traditionally, biosecurity — often under the more restrictive term “quarantine” — has primarily focused on agriculture and related industries. Today, the concept is understood to include other major sectors of the economy and environment, and to engage the broad community. Biosecurity now encompasses prevention and mitigation fromdiseases, pests, and bioterrorism, and has major economic and social implications for the following sectors:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Environment and biodiversity (both terrestrial and marine ecosystems)</li>
            <li>Agriculture (animals and plants)</li>
            <li>Forestry (native forests and plantations)</li>
            <li>Fisheries (marine, freshwater, and aquaculture)</li>
            <li>Tourism (tourists and the environment)</li>
            <li>Water supplies</li>
            <li>Amenity and recreation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Galapagos, biosecurity measures have been introduced in an attempt to ensure that the ecosystems and ecologies sustaining the native flora and fauna as well as human communities are maintained. As such, biosecurity is the business and responsibility of the entire Galapagos community. The primary concern is the introduction and establishment of aggressive invasive species, including diseases, pests, and dominant competitors and predators.</p>
        <p>Biosecurity can be divided into two major areas: prevention and mitigation. Key components of biosecurity in Galapagos include: 1) inspection and quarantine system (prevention); 2) control and eradication of both newly arrived and established invasive species (mitigation); and 3) building community awareness, support, and participation for these programs (prevention and mitigation).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
        <h3>Inspection and Quarantine</h3>
        <p>The Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD), the Ministry of Environment, the Ecuadorian Navy, and others work together to prevent new species and organisms from being introduced into the Galapagos Islands. Prevention protocols include inspection of boats for foreign food, animals, and guns, as well as fumigation and sanitation requirements for boats. As of January 2014, all yacht arrivals may be subject to an Environmental Risk Assessment,which allows the GNPD to conduct an interview with the captain upon arrival and includes the possibility of inspecting the hull of each boat with a diver from the GNPD. The GNPD has the authority to demand that if a yacht fails to meet their requirements and poses a reasonable level of risk, they must leave the Galapagos Marine Reserve.</p>
        <p>An early warning system was also implemented on the inhabited islands, with technicians trained to monitor the ports of entry, agriculture zones, and airplanes for the arrival of high-risk pests. To prevent the establishment of new, dangerous invasive species, such as mosquitoes carrying West Nile Virus, a multi-institutional rapid response system and team were established and contingency plans developed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
        <h3>Involving the Community in Protecting Galapagos</h3>
        <p>Community involvement is critical in invasive species management. Three committees were established to help combat the threat of introduced species: the Agricultural Health and SICGAL Committee (in Santa Cruz) and two Inter-institutional Introduced Species Committees (in San Cristóbal and Santa Cruz). Communication campaigns are used to reach wider audiences, including the use of pamphlets, posters, and numerous television and radiospots. Local teachers receive training to teach concepts related to introduced species, and more than 12,000 school children have participated in events to learn about invasive species impacts, with many actively participating in invasive species projects such as invertebrate monitoring.</p>
        <p>When the inspection and quarantine system fails to prevent the arrival of an invasive species, eradication before it can become established is the next best method in the biosecurity arsenal. This requires a constant flow of information between the Galapagos community and the appropriate research and management institutions. An awareness campaign has improved this connection, with many more members of the community providing information and sometimes specimens of insects and other pests to the authorities. This close working relationship between the community and the authorities is the key to the success of early response and eradication programs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
        <h3>Managing Introduced Species</h3>
        <p>The primary methods to mitigate the damage already done by invasive species that are successfully established are control and eradication, the most costly of the prevention/mitigation techniques in the biosecurity system. Controls and eradications have been carried out primarily by the Galapagos National Park Directorate in collaboration with the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF). Project Isabela, completed in 2006, was one of the most ambitious and ultimately successful eradication projects ever attempted anywhere in the world. It focused on the eradication of goats and donkeys on northern Isabela, and goat, pigs, and donkeys on Santiago.</p>
        <p>Techniques for eradicating invasive species such as fire ants, cats, and plants have also been developed and implemented. Many Galapagos ecosystems are beginning to recover. Teams of Galapagos residents who were trained during these projects are now applying these new eradication techniques throughout Galapagos. The methods developed in Galapagos are also now being applied in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>A key component of successful response is knowledge of the threat and the ability to prioritize research and management efforts. Considerable groundwork has been completed to identify major invasive species threats in Galapagos and to learn more about how these species interact with Galapagos species. Inventories of the urban and agricultural zones identified over 500 new introduced plants and invertebrates.</p>
        <p>As a result of these surveys, the reference collections have been expanded and databases on introduced vertebrates, plants, and invertebrates, including their biology, distribution, and possible control, are now available to decision-makers. Tools have also been developed to identify which species pose the greatest risk to Galapagos and where in the archipelago immediate management actions are required.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">    
        <h2>Climate Change</h2>
        <p>The unique climate of Galapagos is intrinsically linked to its exceptional biodiversity. Strong El Niño events and variations in local climatic conditions have long defined the archipelago’s natural ecosystems, human welfare, and the interactions between the two.</p>
        <p>With a change in global climate, El Niño events, which cause increases in sea temperature and rainfall, could be more frequent and intense. Combined with pressure from human activities they could severely impact ecosystem function and the natural recuperation of living communities in the terrestrial and marine systems. Global climate change could also cause shifts in global resources, markets, and economies that will influence livelihoods of Galapagos inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Scientists in Galapagos are studying the ties between climate, biodiversity and the human element. They are analyzing the adaptability of Galapagos to climate change and working to predict the ecosystem response to changes in the frequency and strength of El Niño events, rainfall patterns, increases in sea temperature, sea level change, and acidification of the world’s oceans.</p>
        <p>Serious questions remain to be answered: How will the Galapagos ecosystem respond to climate change? Which endemic species or communities are most vulnerable and which require the most protection? How will invasive species, one of the most significant threats to Galapagos, respond to climate change and affect system resilience and alter conservation priorities? </p>
        <p>Research will confirm the priority vulnerable species and prepare management plans to reduce human-caused threats from fisheries, tourism, and other activities of the human population in Galapagos.</p>
        <p>Scientists expect that Galapagos penguins, marine iguanas, and mangrove stands are particularly susceptible to climate change. Land-based reptiles adapted to arid conditions, some of which have temperature dependent sex determination, will also be studied.</p>

        <h2 id="projectarea">Project Areas</h2>
        <h3>Galapagos Conservancy focuses most of its attention and resources on four priority program areas:
    </h3>
        <p>In the area of <strong>Ecosystem Restoration,</strong> we work closely with the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF), the Galapagos National Park Service (GNPS), local NGOs, Ecuadorian agencies and various US universities to rebuild healthy, balanced plant and animal communities and establish management strategies to ensure the sustainability of these communities in perpetuity. The restoration of giant tortoise populations is a major component of this work.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>Knowledge Management</strong> Program is developing new ways to collect, store, share, and utilize information resources. The goal is to develop a unifying, accessible portal that will serve both as a destination for diverse data and as an easily accessible source of existing information that is needed for better public policy, research, and management. Partners in this work include Governing Council of Galapagos, the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF), the Galapagos National Park Service (GNPS), local municipalities, ministries of the Ecuadorian government, Ecuadorian and international universities and individual researchers.</p>
        <p>GC's <strong>Sustainable</strong> program is based on the premise that long-term protection of Galapagos requires an economic system that is compatible with biodiversity conservation, an educational system that prepares citizens to be stewards of the archipelago, and a strong civil society dedicated to and engaged in Galapagos conservation. Together with local non-profit organizations, businesses, community leaders, municipal governments and cooperatives, we invest in educational reform (pre-k-12 and non-formal environmental education), building local capacity in areas such as sustainable agriculture and environmental management, and public fora to air concerns and seek solutions to the way society relates to key conservation issues.</p>
        <p>In the are of <strong>Marine Conservation,</strong> we support the work of In the area of Marine Conservation, we support the work of the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park service and local non-profit organizations who seek to protect the distinctive species and habitats of the Marine Reserve. These must be preserved, not only for the intrinsic value of this uniquely diverse ecosystem, but also because its location at a major junction in global ocean circulation provides an unparalleled opportunity to understand and study global climate change.</p>

        <h3>Restoring Degraded Ecosystems</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge.</strong> Ecological damage caused long ago by whalers, pirates and early settlers and exacerbated by more recent human activity and the presence of aggressive introduced species, has disrupted natural biological processes in Galapagos. If left unchecked, the islands will suffer irreversible losses of native and endemic wildlife.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach.</strong> Galapagos Conservancy’s Ecosystem Restoration efforts seek to rebuild healthy, balanced plant and animal communities to their pre-human condition and establish management strategies to ensure the sustainability of these communities well into the future. A key component of this effort is the identification of systems and agents with historical, current, or potentially negative impacts on Galapagos ecosystems and the development of methods to reverse or control them.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Partners.</strong> The Charles Darwin Foundation, the Galapagos National Park Directorate, local non-profit organizations, Ecuadorian agencies responsible for agriculture and the Quarantine System, and researchers from various US universities are all important partners in our Ecosystem Restoration work.</p>
        <p>We are working closely with our partners to:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Complete Project Pinta, ensuring the re-establishment of a reproductive population of tortoises to restore the islands natural ecosystem functions.</li>
            <li>Improve monitoring of long-term, island-wide restoration efforts on the islands of Pinta, Española, Isabela,Floreana, and Santiago.</li>
            <li>Breed and rear tortoises with Floreana ancestry for the eventual tortoise repopulation of Floreana, and begin to plan the potential return of land iguanas to Santiago.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="i-about">
        <h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge Management</h2>
        <h3>Unlocking Information for Science and Conservation</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge.</strong> Although Galapagos is one of the most studied places in the world, access to basic scientific information is surprisingly difficult. Information is held in disperse archives and databases in Galapagos and around the world. There are no shared data collection and archiving protocols. Potential users of data often do not know what exists and as a result often duplicate research and data collection or make decisions based on incomplete and sometimes outdated information. In Galapagos there is a very real need for improved development of, access to, and use of knowledge about the Galapagos Islands to ensure effective natural resource management, decision-making, and policy development in support of biodiversity conservation and a sustainable society.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach.</strong>  Through the Knowledge Management initiative, we are building the growing awareness in Galapagos of the need to develop new ways to collect, store, share, and utilize information resources. The goal is to develop a unifying, accessible portal that will serve both as a destination for diverse data and as an easily accessible source of existing information that is needed for better public policy, research, and management.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Partners.</strong> The Governing Council in Galapagos, the Galapagos National Park service, the Charles Darwin Foundation, local municipalities, ministries of the Ecuadorian government, and Ecuadorian and international universities are all collaborating in the Knowledge Management initiative.</p>
        <p>We are working with our partners to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Impliment a mulit-year, multi-institutional work plan</strong> to build the institutional capacity, relationships, infrastructure and protocols needed for improved knowledge management in Galapagos</li>
            <li><strong>Impliment a mulit-year, multi-institutional work plan</strong> needed to engage and benefit from the observations of Citizen Scientists (both tourists and local residents)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="sustainable">Sustainable Society</h2>
        <h3>Developing a Sustainable Society</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge.</strong> The resident population in Galapagos has grown rapidly since the 1970s, primarily through migration from the Ecuadorian mainland. Today, 75% of those living in Galapagos migrated from outside of the archipelago, drawn by expectation of better economic opportunity (2010 Ecuador Census). Until recently, the capacity of the regional government and local municipalities in the areas of regional planning and the provision of public services has been limited and there have been few civil society organizations (non-profits and voluntary organizations) to complement the work of national, regional and local agencies. Residents have relied heavily on the importation of food (in particular, imported produce — one of the leading source of invasive species) and often seek to replicate lifestyles on the mainland (reliance on cars and trucks; heavy use of electricity; preference for non-native species in gardening; mainland construction techniques, etc.) which are often at odds with the environment. The education system in the islands has been unable to develop the basic and professional skills demanded in the local economy or the deep understanding and appreciation of Galapagos that is needed for residents to become champions of conservation.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach.</strong>  Long-term protection of Galapagos requires an economic system that is compatible with biodiversity conservation, an educational system that prepares citizens to be stewards of the archipelago, and a strong civil society dedicated to and engaged in Galapagos conservation. With this in mind, we are working with local non-profits, including the Scalesia Foundation and Fundar Galapagos, municipal governments, the Governing Council, the Charles Darwin Foundation, and the private sector to support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Educational reform.</strong> with a focus on establishing examples of best practices in Galapagos classrooms and professional development for Galapagos teachers and administrators</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity building</strong> in areas such as sustainable agriculture and environmental management</li>
            <li><strong>Citizen engagement</strong> in public dialogue and decision making through public fora, citizen science and community action group</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="marineconserve">Marine Conservation</h2>
        <h3>Protecting the Galapagos MArine Reserve: A Living Laboratory</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge.</strong> The waters surrounding the Galapagos islands have been under tremendous pressure ever since British and US whalers entered the eastern Pacific in the mid 1800s. In the 20th century, industrial tuna fishing boats and long liners began to exploit the area in large numbers. While industrial fishing was made illegal in the Galapagos Marine Reserve by the Special Law for Galapagos in 1998, the size of the Reserve and the limited resources available for interdiction makes controlling such activity very difficult.</p>

    Additionally, in the 1990s, lucrative markets for sea cucumbers and illegal shark fins fueled explosive growth in fishing with sobering environmental consequences. The now depleted state of the sea cucumber and lobster populations heralded the near collapse of these fisheries, but in the absence of alternatives there is intense pressure to expand fishing in Galapagos.
    </p>
            <p>Scientists have yet to identify much of the biodiversity in the marine reserve, and baseline data regarding many identified species is limited. Little is known about the impact of environmental pressures on migratory species, such as Whale Sharks and the Waved Albatross, or about the eventual impact in Galapagos of environmental pressures occurring outside of the marine reserve.</p>
            <p>There is urgent need to develop a comprehensive and scientifically sound approach to managing this ecosystem, which includes the development and promotion of real economic alternatives that are sustainable within the Galapagos context. Galapagos Conservancy, in conjunction with our partners in the islands, is positioned to play a leading role in funding this work, but we require support from our membership and supporters to get the job done.
    </p>
            <p><strong>Our Approach.</strong>  We support the work of the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park Service and local non-profit organizations who seek to protect the distinctive species and habitats of the Marine Reserve. These must be preserved, not only for the intrinsic value of this uniquely diverse ecosystem, but also because its location at a major junction in global ocean circulation provides an unparalleled opportunity to understand and study global climate change.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
    <h2 id="emerging">Emerging Issues</h2>
        <p>Recognizing the continually changing conditions in Galapagos, Galapagos Conservancy began a program to ensure timely identification and evaluation of emerging or sentinel conservation issues, in order to highlight new or potential problem areas before their impact becomes extensive and/or irreversible.</p>
        <p>At present, Galapagos Conservancy is funding two projects that respond to anecdotal information received over the years by credible Galapagos experts who have expressed concern over the status of two iconic Galapagos bird species.</p>
        <h3>Rapid Response to Emerging Conservation Issues</h3>
        <p>This area of Galapagos Conservancy’s conservation priorities intersects research and implementation as well as emerging conservation issues, and may be better characterized as a funding vehicle rather than a program area.</p>
        <p>Rapid response simply acknowledges that situations occur outside of planned investments in key areas to which Galapagos Conservancy should respond. Grants will be made in response to true emergencies for which we determine that, without immediate attention, there will be a negative impact on Galapagos biodiversity. These are situations for which a quick infusion of funding resources will significantly increase or improve our work and that of our conservation partners in Galapagos. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="i-about">
        <h2 id="uav">Unmanned Aerial Vehicals</h2>
        <p>The goal of the Galapagos UAV project is to design and build small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with cameras as “payload” to take high-resolution aerial images at pre-programmed sampling points in the archipelago. The resulting images will be compiled and made available to the Galapagos National Park as raw imagery, and modified to be viewable on a Google Earth platform for researchers, “citizen scientists,” and others to view and engage with the data.</p>
        <p>This type of photography, called drone photography, has proven to be extremely useful, cost-effective, and especially suited to Galapagos ecosystem monitoring — and opens up an array of opportunities for measuring and monitoring the environment. Current satellite images allow for viewing basic aspects of ecosystems, such as where water meets land and where forests meet bare ground. However, it is not possible to see animals in such images. The Galapagos drone images make it possible to identify individual plants and animals, all with virtually no disturbance to the animals or environmental impacts compared to a survey on foot.</p>
        <p>The high level of detail captured by the UAV images will allow researchers to make individual measurements, population counts, ecosystem delineation, and many other possibilities important for conservation. The research team plans to initially target the islands of Santa Cruz, Plazas, Sante Fe, and Española Islands, with follow-up images taken at the same points in several years in order to monitor change over time. Specifically, the team hopes to obtain initial imagery that can be used to survey the number of waved albatross and prickly pear cactus on Española, land iguanas on South Plazas, and eventually giant tortoises on Santa Fe. </p>
        <p>This technology is an important tool for advancing scientific research and environmental monitoring in the archipelago. It will produce select imagery for others to examine to explore the value of UAVs in the Galapagos Islands in the future.</p>

        <h2 id="thermal">Thermal Imaging of Giant Tortoises</h2>
        <p>On a radio tracking expedition in May 2013 on Santa Cruz Island in Galapagos, Dr. Glenn Tattersall, Professor of Biological Sciences at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, had the opportunity to utilize an infrared thermal imaging camera (FLIR SC660) to photograph the tortoises in the Santa Cruz highlands, as well as those at the Captive Breeding Center in Puerto Ayora. Joined by Dr. James Gibbs of SUNY-ESF at Syracuse, Steve Blake, Susan Flowers, and Sebastien Cruz, the team captured hundreds of unique images that provide more information about the temperature fluctuations within a tortoise’s body.</p>
        <p>This work could result in a new interpretation of why tortoise shell shape varies based on environmental adaptations to climate and temperature. In addition, more information of this nature could help with understanding how tortoises manage in the extreme Galapagos environment without turning into a crisp in the arid zones nor chilling to ill health in the highlands in cooler months. This is the first of what we hope will be many chances to see a different side—and color—of the Galapagos Giant Tortoise!</p>

        <h3><strong>Status:</strong> Finded in 2013; ongoing</h3>
        
        <p>In the summer of 2013, a series of four “tortoise-cams” and supporting web and app delivery systems were installed at the tortoise pens at the Fausto Llerena Tortoise Center at the Galapagos National Park Directorate campus on Santa Cruz Island in Galapagos. Due to the inconsistent and unreliable internet connectivity to the islands, these cameras have been programmed to detect and record footage only when there is movement in the frame. The webcams run continuously, and uploads are sent daily to a remote server where the selected footage is combined into one continuous streaming video that highlights the best action from all four cameras from the previous day.</p>
        <p>Web cameras are fast becoming an important tool to engage the broad public in species protection and awareness around the world. Galapagos Conservancy is very proud to have played a significant role in initiating the establishment of the first webcams in the Galapagos Islands; it is our hope that these cameras will engage visitors and residents of the islands with their unique perspective into the lives of giant tortoises living at the Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz Island. The cameras are hosted by the Galapagos National Park Directorate.</p>
        <p>Galapagos Conservancy thanks Dr. Jim Gallagher for his generosity in funding the purchase and installation of the webcams. Thanks also goes to the Galapagos National Park Directorate, Dr. James Gibbs of SUNY-ESF, and Sean Burnett of Wildlife Intel for their invaluable guidance in bringing these webcams to life.</p>

        <h3>Early History of the Galapagos Giant Tortoise Conservation Program</h3>
        <p>With the establishment of the Galapagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation in 1959, one of the first orders of business was to determine the status of the giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.  When it was discovered that the central, small island of Pinzón had only 100-200 very old adults and no young tortoises had survived into adulthood for perhaps more than 70 years, the resident scientists initiated what would eventually become the Giant Tortoise Breeding and Rearing Program. Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.</p>
        <p>In 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinzón Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. It turned out that the introduction of black rats onto Pinzón sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. It was only the longevity of giant tortoises that allowed them to survive until conservation scientists and managers began to focus on Galapagos and the long path back to ecosystem restoration. Young tortoises were reared at the center until approximately 4-5 years old, when they were considered “rat-proof,” and then returned to Pinzón Island.</p>
        <p>After discovering the problem on Pinzón, a more drastic situation was found on the southern island of Española, where only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and twelve females.  It appeared that the tortoises were not encountering one another and, therefore, no reproduction was occurring.  Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated. In 1977, a third Española male tortoise was returned to Galapagos from the San Diego Zoo and joined the breeding group.</p>
        <p>Within a few years, the rearing program (bringing eggs and/or hatchlings from the wild and rearing them until ready for repatriation) was expanded to include other threatened populations, including tortoises from Santiago Island, Santa Cruz Island, San Cristóbal Island, Wolf Volcano (Isabela Island), and both volcanoes of southern Isabela. Each population had its own set of problems, ranging from predation by rats, pigs, wild dogs and introduced ants, to low levels of juvenile survival and habitat destruction by goats. With the establishment of the Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD) in 1968, the program was managed jointly by the Charles Darwin Research Station and the GNPD. This collaboration provided the perfect combination of research and management to ensure an effective and successful program.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Lonesome George was found on Pinta Island and brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz.  It was hoped that more Pinta tortoises would be found, either on Pinta or in one of the world’s zoos, similar to the discovery of the Española male in San Diego. Unfortunately none were ever found and Lonesome George died in June 2012, 40 years after having been brought to the center, without ever having reproduced. With his death came the extinction of the Pinta Island giant tortoise species.</p>

        <h4>Breeding Program</h4>
        <p>The breeding program at the Santa Cruz tortoise center has been focused almost exclusively on the Española tortoises. Additional breeding programs were begun in Puerto Villamil on Isabela Island for tortoises from several populations on Isabela, and on San Cristóbal Island, for its native tortoises. In each breeding corral, several nesting zones are constructed by excavating an area and providing the correct type of soil that allows the female tortoises to successfully nest. Peak breeding season occurs in the hot season (February/March), followed by the nesting season, which begins at the start of the cooler garúa (light rain) season in June and ends in November/December as the cool season comes to a close.</p>
        <p>Nests are opened by the park rangers who oversee the program, and the eggs are transferred to the incubators. Research at the center showed that the gender of Galapagos tortoises is determined by the incubation temperature, a characteristic known as “temperature-dependent sex determination,” which is found in many reptiles. To help the populations increase more rapidly, 2/3 of the eggs are incubated at the female temperature and 1/3 at the male temperature.</p>
        <h4>Rearing Program</h4>
        <p>The majority of the tortoise populations in the program do not have adults in captivity. Instead, the adults reproduce naturally on their island and park rangers collect eggs and/or hatchlings from natural nests toward the end of the incubation season. The eggs/hatchlings are transported to Santa Cruz. The eggs complete their incubation at the center and all tortoises then enter the rearing program, as do the hatchlings from Española. All hatchlings are marked and measured.</p>
        <p>For approximately the first two years of life, young tortoises are kept in their own group in enclosed corrals, on a soil substrate. The corrals are all covered at night, as there are introduced rats on Santa Cruz and they will (albeit rarely) prey on the youngest tortoises.  Once the tortoises reach a certain size (approximately 2 years old), they are transferred to “adaptation” corrals. These are simply fenced sections of the natural terrain where the tortoises from the various populations can roam freely over lava and feed occasionally on natural vegetation.</p>
        <p>In all corrals the tortoises are provided pools where they can drink and refresh themselves. They are fed every couple of days and are regularly monitored.</p>
        <h4>Repatraitions</h4>
        <p>Young tortoises are returned to their island of origin at 4-5 years old, which has been found to be the best age/size for future survival. The animals are quarantined prior to transport to their island, transported on boat in wooden boxes, and then carried in backpacks by rangers up to their appropriate release sites. The first 20 young tortoises from the first eggs collected on Pinzón Island were returned to that island in 1970. The first 17 Española juveniles that resulted from the new breeding program were returned to their home island in 1975. As of 2013, more than 4,000 tortoises have been repatriated to their islands of origin.</p>

        <h3>Tortoise Research, Management and Workshops</h3>
        <h4>Research Management</h4>
        <p>Adaptive management of the tortoise center responds to results from research done both at the center and in the wild. During the first 35 years of the tortoise center, the program was run jointly by the Charles Darwin Research Station and the Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD). During those decades there were several studies focused on all aspects of the program, including nesting, incubation, rearing, and repatriations. As the results were incorporated into the management program, the success rates continually improved. Mortality rates at the center declined significantly with improvements in both incubation and rearing. Survival of repatriates has improved based on monitoring of tortoises repatriated at various sizes/ages.
    </p>
        <p>Around the year 2000, the program was turned over to the Galapagos National Park Directorate in its entirety. Since that time, the GNPD has worked with a team of international tortoise experts in determining the future of the program.</p>
        <h3>The Future of Giant Tortoises in Galapagos</h3>
        <p>In 2015, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the start of the Tortoise Center. The successes have been phenomenal, with all tortoise populations included in the program in much better shape than when the Galapagos National Park was established in 1959. But there is much more to do.</p>
        <p>Under the umbrella of the Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative, the next decade could see major advances in securing the long-term conservation of Galapagos giant tortoise populations and the ecosystems they depend on and modify. We should see the return of tortoises to Pinta and Floreana Islands that are genetically similar to the tortoises native to those islands, the return of tortoises to Santa Fe, results of tortoise-cactus-woody vegetation research informing future management decisions on habitat restoration, increased genetic diversity in the tortoise population on Española through selective breeding of the native adults, and many more successes that will continue to enhance the numbers of Galapagos tortoises, with the very long-term goal of reaching numbers equivalent to those prior to the devastation of tortoise populations in the first half of the 19th century. The best is yet to come.</p>
