            <p class="shop-paragraph">One of the most iconic species in Galapagos, the Giant Tortoise is a vital partner in ecosystem restoration efforts. Slow-moving and capable of surviving without food and water for an entire year, these creatures nearly became extinct after whalers and pirates used them as a primary food source while at sea. Now you can help support important Galapagos conservation efforts by symbolically adopting of tortoise of your own!</p>
